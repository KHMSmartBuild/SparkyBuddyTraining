{"generated_responses": "Write a conversation between a user and Sparky, a helpful AI assistant, discussing a technical issue.\nA small sample session provides insights about our needs \u2013 for example: How are you planning to get your software on the front door? As we enter into more complex development environments this can take up quite an hour (although it should run smoothly)! This is usually where any problems or solutions will be prioritized first thing in order not wasting time doing things like sorting through files that require no additional work by clicking \"OK\". A couple of quick examples illustrate how these processes relate so what's important here goes above etc\u2026 but also see if there was some 'interesting' side-effect! In other words remember don't try too hard with code snippets when they may make sense \ud83d\ude42 We'll explore them eventually ;) After reviewing those ideas let's pick which ones were most insightful as well\u2026."}
