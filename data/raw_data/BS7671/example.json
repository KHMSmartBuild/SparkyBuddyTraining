By  the  time  of  the  First \nWorld  War  (1914\u20131918),  there  were  some  600  independent  power \n stations  in  use.  However,  the  heavy  demands  made  by  the  war  indus-\ntry  showed  the  inadequacies  of  the  system  and  several  select  commit-\ntees were set up to investigate possible changes. Little was achieved until \n1926,  when  it  was  suggested  that  126  of  the  largest  and  most  ef\ufb01cient \npower stations should be selected and connected by a grid of high-voltage \n\n18th Edition IET Wiring Regulations: Electric Wiring for Domestic Installers. 978-1-138-60604-3.\n\u00a9 Brian Scaddan.

The  remaining  power  stations  would  \nbe closed down and local supply authorities would obtain their electricity \nin bulk from the grid, via suitable substations. The system voltage was \n132 000 V (132 kV) and the supply frequency 50 Hz.\n\nOn 1 April 1948, the whole of the electricity supply industry was nation-\nalized  and,  in  1957,  the  \u2018Central  Authority\u2019  responsible  for  the  genera-\ntion of electricity was renamed the \u2018Central Electricity Generating Board\u2019 \n(CEGB).\n\nSince  then,  of  course,  the  electricity  industry  has  become  privatized \nand the CEGB has been replaced by the National Grid Company, which \nbuys,  at  the  lowest  price,  generated  electricity  from  such  companies  as \nNational Power, PowerGen, Nuclear Electric, French Electrique and Scot-\ntish Hydro Electric.\n\nElectricity boards have become Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) \nand they, in turn, buy electrical energy from the National Grid Company \nto distribute to their own consumers.\n\nThe broad structure of the industry is shown in Figure 1.1.\n\nVOLTAGE BANDS\n\nThe very nature of the grid system is such that power has to be transmit-\nted  over  large  distances.  This  immediately  creates  a  problem  of  voltage \ndrop. To overcome this problem, a high voltage is used for transmission \n(400 or 132 kV), the 400 kV system being known as the \u2018Super Grid\u2019. We \ncannot, however, generate at such high voltages (the maximum in modern \ngenerators is 25 kV) and transformers are used to step up the generated \nvoltage to the transmission voltage. At the end of a transmission line is \na grid substation, where the requirements of the grid system in that area \ncan be controlled and where the transmission voltage is stepped down via \na transformer to 132 kV.\n\nIt is at this stage that the different DNOs distribute the power required by \ntheir consumers around that particular area. The system voltage is then  \nfurther reduced at substations to 33 000, 11 000 and 415/240 V (Figure 1.2).\n\n\fThe UK Generation, Transmission and Distribution System 3\n\nGENERATION \n\nPowerGen \n\nNational  Power \n\nNuelear Eleetrie, ete. \n\nTRANSMISSION \n\nNational Grid Company \n\nDISTRIBUTION \n\nThe distribution network operators \n\nIndustrial, eommereial and domestie eonsumers \n\nFIGURE 1.1\n\nThe  declared  voltage  at  consumers\u2019  terminals  is  now  400  V  three-\nphase/230 V single-phase +10 to 6%. However, the measured voltage is \nstill likely to be 415/240 V for many years.\n\nThe  Wiring  Regulations  BS  7671:2008  indicate  two  voltage  bands,  as \nfollows:\n\nVoltage band 1: Extra Low Voltage (ELV) which does not exceed 50 Vac. In \ndomestic installations ELV is used for bell and call systems,12 V lighting \n(incorrectly  called  low  voltage  lighting  by  manufacturers)  and  for  some \ncircuits  in  bath/shower  rooms,  where  it  is  Separated  Extra  Low  Voltage \n(SELV). See also Chapter 4 Bathrooms.\n\nVoltage band 2: Low voltage (LV) which exceeds ELV (50 Vac) but does not \nexceed  1000 Vac.  These  circuits  cover  the  normal  domestic  circuits  for \npower and lighting.\n\n\fs\nm\nr\na\nF\n\nV\n0\n3\n2\n\nV\n0\n3\n2\n\n/\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n\nr\ne\nm\nr\no\nf\ns\nn\na\nr\nT\n\ny\nr\nt\ns\nu\nd\nn\n\ni\n\nt\nh\ng\nL\n\ni\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\ns\nd\nr\na\no\nB\ny\nt\ni\nc\ni\nr\nt\nc\ne\nE\n\nl\n\ny\nt\ni\nc\ni\nr\nt\nc\ne\ne\n1\n0\n\nl\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nu\nb\ni\nr\nt\ns\nd\n\ni\n\n.\no\nC\nd\ni\nr\n\nG\n\nl\n\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nN\n\nh\nc\nn\ne\nr\nF\nc\ni\nr\nt\nc\ne\nE\n\nl\n\nl\n\nr\na\ne\nc\nu\nN\n\nh\ns\ni\nt\nt\no\nc\nS\n\ne\nu\nq\ni\nr\nt\nc\ne\nE\n\nl\n\nl\n\nc\ni\nr\nt\nc\ne\nE\no\nr\nd\ny\nH\n\nr\ne\nw\no\nP\n\nl\n\na\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nN\n\nn\ne\nG\nr\ne\nw\no\nP\n\nd\nn\na\n\ni\n\ni\n\nn\no\ns\ns\nm\ns\nn\na\nr\nt\n\n,\nn\no\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\nn\ne\nG\n\nd\ni\nr\n\nG\n\nr\ne\np\nu\nS\n\ni\n\n:\ns\ne\nn\na\np\nm\no\nc\n\ng\nn\ni\nt\na\nr\ne\nn\ne\nG\n\nV\n0\n3\n2\n\n/\n\n0\n0\n4\n\ns\nn\nw\no\nT\n\nd\nn\na\n\ns\ne\ng\na\n\nl\nl\ni\n\nv\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\ny\nr\nt\ns\nu\nd\nn\n\ni\n\ny\nv\na\ne\nH\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n2\n3\n1\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nV\n0\n3\n2\n\n/\n\n0\n0\n4\n\n/\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n\n/\n\n0\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\nV\n0\n0\n 0\n3\n3\n\n/\n\n0\n0\n 0\n2\n3\n1\n\nr\ne\nm\nr\no\nf\ns\nn\na\nr\nT\n\nr\ne\nm\nr\no\nf\ns\nn\na\nr\nT\n\nr\ne\nm\nr\no\ns\nn\na\nr\nT\n\nl\n\nm\ne\nt\ns\ny\ns\nd\n\ni\nr\n\nG\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n\nr\ne\nm\nr\no\nf\ns\nn\na\nr\nT\n\nV\n0\n0\n0\n2\n3\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n\n.\n\nm\ne\nt\ns\ny\ns\n\ny\ng\nr\ne\nn\ne\n\nl\n\nl\n\na\nc\ni\nr\nt\nc\ne\ne\nK\nU\ne\nh\nT\n\n.\n\n2\n1\nE\nR\nU\nG\nI\nF\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fThe UK Generation, Transmission and Distribution System 5\n\nTHE ELECTRICITY SAFETY, QUALITY AND  \nCONTINUITY REGULATIONS 2002 (ESQCR)\n\nClearly, from the public\u2019s point of view, there must be safeguards from the \ndangers  that  electricity  supply  systems  may  create  and  also  guarantees \nthat, other than in exceptional circumstances, a constant supply will be \nmaintained.\n\nSuch  safeguards  and  guarantees  are  embedded  in  the  Electricity  Safety, \nQuality and Continuity Regulations 2002.\n\nWith regard to a consumer installation, the regulations advise the supplier \n(usually the DNO) to provide a service cable, protective device and any \nwiring up to the consumer \u2019s supply terminals.\n\nThey  also  require  the  supplier  to  give  written  details  of  external  loop \nimpedance and prospective short-circuit values.\n\nThe regulations also permit the supplier to withhold or discontinue a sup-\nply if it is considered that the consumer\u2019s installation is not safe or could \ninterfere with the public supply.\n\nTHE ELECTRICITY AT WORK REGULATIONS 1989\n\nThese regulations come under the umbrella of the Health and Safety at \nWork  Act  1974  and  supersede  the  Factories  Act  (Special  Regulations) \n1908 and 1944. They affect every person at work, whether an employer, \nan employee or a self-employed person, and they place a duty on each per-\nson to carry out safe working practices with regard to matters (electrical) \nthat are within his or her control.\n\nThis  piece  of  legislation  is  the  only  one  in  the  United  Kingdom  that \nassumes anyone who contravenes certain regulations to be guilty. Such a \nperson then has to demonstrate that he or she took all reasonable steps to \nprevent danger in order to prove his or her innocence and avoid prosecution.\n\nTHE IET WIRING REGULATIONS (BS 7671)\n\nThese  regulations,  although  having  British  Standard  status,  are  non- \nstatutory. However, they may be used in a court of law to claim compliance \n\n\f6\n\nThe UK Generation, Transmission and Distribution System\n\nwith  statutory  regulations  such  as  the  Electricity  at  Work  Regulations \n1989.\n\nThey  are,  basically,  a  set  of  recommendations  dealing  with  the  safe \ndesign, construction, inspection and testing of low-voltage installations. \nThere is no point at this stage in expanding further on these regulations, \nas they will be referred to throughout the remaining chapters.\n\nTHE BUILDING REGULATIONS 2010 PART \u2018P\u2019\n\nThe  following  material  is  taken  from  The  Building  Regulations \n2000 approved document P. \u00a9 Crown Copyright material is reproduced \nwith the permission of the controller of HMSO and Queen\u2019s Printer for \nScotland.\n\nPart \u2018P\u2019\n\nPart \u2018P\u2019 of the Building Regulations requires that installations in dwellings \nbe designed, installed and inspected and tested to the requirements of the \ncurrent edition of the IET Wiring Regulations, BS 7671.\n\nDetails of some such work need to be noti\ufb01ed to the Local Building Con-\ntrol Authority (LABC).

The approval body will notify the LABC.\n\nIf  an  installer  is  not  registered  on  a  \u2018Competent  Persons\u2019  scheme,  but \nis quali\ufb01ed to inspect and test, he/she should issue the appropriate cer-\nti\ufb01cate  to  the  LABC.

In \nthis case only an EICR can be issued to the person ordering the work.\n\nPart \u2018P\u2019 is not the only part of the Building Regulations that needs to be \naddressed.

Unfortunately, \nthis also means that persons or livestock in contact with a live part and \nearth are at risk of electric shock (Figure 1.3).\n\nThere are, however, methods of reducing the shock risk and these will be \ndiscussed in Chapter 3.\n\nThere  are  three  main  methods  of  earthing  used  in  the  United  \nKingdom;  these  are  the  TT  system,  the  TNS  system,  and  the  TN-C-S \nsystem. The letter T is the \ufb01rst letter of the French word for earth \u2018terre\u2019, \nand indicates a direct contact to the general mass of earth. The letter N \nindicates that there is also the connection of a conductor to the star or \nneutral point of the supply transformer, which is continuous throughout \nthe  distribution  system  and  terminates  at  the  consumer \u2019s  intake  posi-\ntion.

Also  the  outer  metallic  sheaths  of  the  distribution  cable  and, \nultimately, the service cable are also connected to the star point.

In this case, however, the outer cable sheath is also used as a neu-\ntral conductor (i.e. it is a combined (C) earth and neutral), and is known \nas a PEN (protective earthed neutral) conductor.\n\nHowever, the system inside the consumer\u2019s premises continues to have \nseparate (S) earth and neutral conductors (Figure 1.6).\n\nThese are the three main earthing systems used in the United Kingdom. \nThey  all  rely  on  an  earthed  star  point  of  the  supply  transformer  and \n various methods of providing an earth path for fault currents.\n\n\f10\n\nThe UK Generation, Transmission and Distribution System\n\nConsumer's \ninstallation \n\nSupply \n\nN \n\nEarth electrode \n\nMetal cable sheath \n\nGeneral mass 01  earth \n\n(Single-phase shown lor clarity) \n\nSeparate neutral and earth conductors \n\n  FIGURE 1.5    TN-S system.\n\nSupply \n\nConsumer's \ninstallation \n\nN \n\nPEN conductor \nArmour 01 supply cable \n\nLink in \nconsumer's cut-out \n\nEarth electrode \n\nL \n\nN \n\nE \n\nL \n\nN \n\nE \n\nGeneral mass 01 earth \n\n(Single-phase shown lor clarity) \n\nCombined earth and  neutral conductor for supply \nSeparate earth and neutral in consumer's installation \nThe DNO's part of the system is known as protective multiple earthing (PME) \n\n  FIGURE 1.6    TN-C-S system.\n\n\fC H A P T E R   2\n\nDomestic Electrical \nInstallations\n\nImportant terms/topics covered in this chapter:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) The main intake position\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Main protective bonding conductors\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)Radial \n\nlighting  circuits  including  two-way  and  intermediate \n\nswitching\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Ring \ufb01nal circuits\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Cable types and installation methods\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Cable terminations\n\nBy the end of this chapter the reader should:\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)have  an  understanding  of  the  arrangement  of  equipment  at  the \n\n origin of an installation,\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)be aware of the various typical circuit arrangements and how they \n\nare wired,\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)know  the  methods  of  cable  support/termination  and  protection \n\nagainst damage.\n\nTHE MAIN INTAKE POSITION\n\nUnless  domestic  premises  are  extremely  large,  it  is  unlikely  that  a \n three-phase supply would be needed, and consequently only single-phase \nsystems  will  be  considered  here.

Energy is consumed out of normal \nhours, for example 11.00 pm to 7.00 am, and the tariff (the charge per \nunit of energy used) is a lot less.\n\nThis  arrangement  lends  itself  to  the  use  of  storage  heaters  and  water \nheating, and the supply intake equipment will incorporate special meter-\ning  arrangements.  The  DNOs  have  their  own  variations  on  a  common \n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n13\n\nMeter \nMeter \n\nkwh \n\nConsumer unit \n\nBonding to gas \nand water, etc. \n\nMain \nearthing terminal \n\nCuMlul \n\nEarthing conductor \n\nEarth clamp to \narmouring \n\nService cable \n\n  FIGURE 2.2    TN-S system.\n\nMeter \n\nkwh \n\nLink \n\nCut-out \n\nConsumer  unit \n\nBonding to gas \nand water, etc. \n\nMain \nearthing terminal \n\nEarthing conductor \n\nService cable (armour is N and E) \n\n  FIGURE 2.3    TN-C-S system.\n\n\f14\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nNormal circuits \n\nWater heating \n\nStorage heating \n\nOn-peak \n\nOff-peak \n\nOff-peak \n\nMeter \n\nkwh \n\nCut-out \n\n  FIGURE 2.4    Off-peak system.\n\ntheme, depending on consumers\u2019 requirements, but, typically, the supply \nfrom the cut-out (this houses the DNOs fuse and neutral) feeds a digital \nmeter from which three consumer units are fed: one for normal use, one \nfor storage heating and one for water heating (Figure 2.4).\n\nIn these cases, these meters or telemeters, as they are known, are switched \non and off by radio signals activated from the DNOs\u2019 centre. In the case \nof water heating, there is normally a \u2018mid-day boost\u2019 for about 2 hours. \nIn most DNO areas, electricity used during the night by normal circuits, \nthat is, lighting and power, attracts a lower tariff. As a result, it is cost- \neffective to carry out washing and drying activities during this nighttime \nperiod.\n\nMany  older  installations  incorporate  the  \u2018white  meter\u2019  arrangement \nwhich uses a separate meter to register energy used during off-peak peri-\nods. Although most new installations are based around the tele-metering \nsystem, older metering installations are still valid. They are all variations \non the same theme, that is, they use electricity outside normal hours and \nthe charge per unit will be less.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n15\n\nThe main earthing terminal\n\nThe  intake  arrangements  shown  in  Figures  2.1\u20132.4  all  indicate  a  main \nearthing terminal separate from the consumer unit. In fact, most modern \nunits have an integral earth bar, which can accommodate all the circuit \nearths or circuit protective conductors (cpcs), the earthing conductor and \nthe  main  protective  bonding  conductors.  However,  it  is  probably  more \nconvenient  to  have  a  separate  main  earthing  terminal  to  which  is  con-\nnected the earthing conductor from the consumer unit, the earthing con-\nductor to the means of earthing (earth electrode, cable sheath, etc.) and \nthe main protective bonding conductors. This arrangement is particularly \nuseful when an installation is under test.\n\nAs  mentioned,  the  main  earthing  terminal  is  a  point  to  which  all \nmain  protective  bonding  conductors  are  connected.  These  conduc-\ntors  con-nect together gas, water and oil services, etc., and in so doing, \n maintain such services within the premises at or about earth potential \n(i.e. 0 V). It must be remembered that bonding the installation earthing \nto  these  services  is  not  done  to  gain  an  earth;  many  services  are  now \nrun in non-metallic materials and it is within the premises that bonding \nis so very important. This aspect will be dealt with in greater detail in \nChapter 3.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, bonding of gas services should be carried \nout within 600 mm of the gas meter on the consumer\u2019s side of the meter, \nand  as  near  as  possible  to  the  water  intake  position,  once  again  on  the \nconsumer\u2019s side (Figure 2.5).\n\nThere is no reason why bonding to main services should be carried out \nindividually  and  separately,  provided  that  the  bonding  conductors  are \nunbroken.  This  will  prevent  conductors  from  being  accidentally  pulled \nout of the bonding clamp terminal, leaving one or other of the services \nunbonded (Figure 2.6).\n\nMain isolation\n\nThe main intake position houses, usually as part of the consumer unit, \nthe means to isolate the supply to the whole installation, and there is a \nrequirement  to  ensure  that  such  isolation  be  accessible  at  all  times.

Typical of domestic radial circuits are lighting, water heat-\ning, storage heating and cooking.\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Ring \ufb01nal circuits are almost unique to the United Kingdom.\n\n The ring \ufb01nal circuit is always used to feed 13 A socket outlets to BS \n1363. The circuit starts at the consumer unit, loops in and out of \neach socket and, \ufb01nally, returns to the consumer unit to terminate \nin the same terminals as it started.\n\n \n \n\f18\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nLet us now look at the various circuits in a little more detail.\n\nLighting circuits\n\nThe \u2018loop-in\u2019 system\n\nThis  is  the  most  common  of  all  lighting  circuitry  and,  as  the  name  \nsuggests,  circuit  cables  simply  \u2018loop\u2019  in  and  out  of  each  lighting  point \n(Figure 2.8).\n\nIt should be noted that the cpcs have been omitted from Figure 2.8 for \nclarity.  They  must,  however,  always  be  present.

If, however, the wiring  system \nwere  formed  using  single  conductors  enclosed  in  conduit,  then  both \n conductors from the switch to the light point would be brown (old red) \nand no sleeving would be needed. For further details, see later sections in \nthis chapter.\n\nIt is acceptable to wire two or more lighting points from the previous one \n(i.e. 3 and 4 from 2 in Figure 2.9).\n\nHowever, this causes problems of space in the ceiling rose and overcrowd-\ning  of  terminals.  So  it  is  perhaps  best  to  avoid  this  practice  and  use  a \nlighting junction box (Figure 2.10).\n\nThe need to wire in this way usually arises due to an addition to an exist-\ning system or, in the case of a new installation, when one point is very \nremote from the rest and when making it part of a continuous chain of \npoints would result in considerable extra cable length (Figure 2.11).\n\nThere  are  many  instances  where  two  or  more  points  are  required  to  be \ncontrolled by one switch. In this case, each extra point is wired directly to \nthe lampholder terminals of the previous point (Figure 2.12).\n\nLight \npoint 1 \n\nLight \npoint 2 \n\nLight \npoint 3 \n\nLight \npoint 4 \n\nSwitch \n\nSwitch \n\nSwitch \n\nSwitch \n\n  FIGURE 2.9    Lighting circuit with no junction box.\n\n\f20\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nLight \npoint 1 \n\nLight \npoint 2 \n\nJunction \nbox \n\nLight \npoint 4 \n\nLight \npoint 3 \n\nSwitch \n\nSwitch \n\nSwitch \n\n  FIGURE 2.10    Lighting circuit with junction box.\n\nSwitch \n\nBathroom \n\nJB \n\nEn-suite bathroom \n\nBedroom 1 \n\nFrom \nmains \n\nBedroom 2 \n\nStairs \n\n  FIGURE 2.11    Lighting circuit with junction box.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n21\n\nLampholder \n\nN \n\nN \n\nN \n\nL \n\nBrown \nsleeve \n\nN \n\nL \n\nFrom consumer \nunit \n\nOne-way \nswitch \n\nTo  next light \npoint \n\nBrown sleeve \n\n(cpcs omitted for clarity) \n\n  FIGURE 2.12    One-way switch controlling two points.\n\nSo far, we have only considered one-way switching and, of course, most \ndomestic  premises  have  two-way  systems  and,  in  some  cases,  two-way \nand intermediate.\n\nTwo-way switching is typical of the control of lighting for stair-wells. Two-\nway  and  intermediate  switching  is  typical  of  the  control  of  lighting  for \nlong corridors or three-storey dwellings with two or more landings, where \nlights need to be controlled from more than two places.\n\n\f22\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nLampholder \n\nN \n\nN \n\nN \n\nL \nFrom consumer \nunit \n\nConnectors \n\nThree-core cable \nwith cpc \n\nC \n\nC \n\nBrown sleeve \n\nL 1 \n\nL2 \n\nTwo-way \nswitch \n\nL 1 \n\nL2 \n\n(cpcs omitted for clarity) \n\n  FIGURE 2.13    Two-way switching via the ceiling rose.\n\nTwo-way switching\n\nThere are two methods of wiring a two-way switching system. The \ufb01rst is \nachieved by running a three-core and cpc cable between two-way switches, \nvia the lighting point (Figure 2.13).\n\nThe second method is to wire a twin cable to one two-way switch (as in \none-way  switching)  and  then  to  run  a  three-core  cable  from  this  to  the \nother two-way switch (Figure 2.14).\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n23\n\nLampholder \n\nN \n\nN \n\nBrown sleeve \n\nN \n\nL \nFrom consumer \nunit \n\nTwin cable \nwith cpc \n\nN \n\nL1 \n\nL2 \n\nTwo-way \nswitch \n\nC \n\nL1 \n\nL2 \n\nBrown sleeve \n\nThree-core cable \nwith cpc \n\n(CPCs omitted  for clarity) \n\n  FIGURE 2.14    Two-way switching via the switches.\n\nThe  disadvantage  with  the  \ufb01rst  method  is  that  the  grey  (old  blue)  and \nblack  (old  yellow)  conductors  (found  in  three-core  \ufb02at  cable,  6243  Y), \nknown as strappers, have to be terminated in the light point enclosure. \nAs a result, connectors or crimps must be used as there are no terminals \nprovided. This results in overcrowding of conductors in a con\ufb01ned space \nand as such this method is rarely used.\n\nWith  the  second  method,  the  lighting  point  is  not  physically  involved \nwith the three-core cable. It should be noted that the grey (old blue) and \n\n\f24\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nblack (old yellow) strappers are line conductors and must be identi\ufb01ed as \nsuch with brown (old red) sleeving.\n\nIt  is  useful  to  note  that  the  second  method  is  a  simple  means  of \n converting  one-way  switching  to  two-way,  without  disturbing  the \nwiring  to  the  light  point.  All  that  is  required  is  a  change  of  switch  \nfrom  one-way  to  two-way  and  the  installation  of  an  extra  two-way  \nswitch with three-core cable wired between them. Typical of this would \nbe  converting  a  one-way  system  in,  say,  a  bedroom,  to  two-way  by \n changing the switch by the door and adding a two-way pull cord switch \nover the bed.\n\nAs  all  conductors  (except  cpcs)  between  two-way  switches  are  line  con-\nductors, it does not matter which colours go to which terminals, as long \nas the arrangement is the same at both switches and grey (old blue) and \nblack (old yellow) are identi\ufb01ed as brown (old red).\n\nTwo-way and intermediate switching\n\nThis  is  simply  an  extension  of  the  two-way  system,  whereby  one  or \nmore  intermediate  switches  are  wired  between  the  two-way  switches \n(Figure 2.15).\n\nFeeding the switch\n\nAs we have seen, the most common method of installing lighting circuits \nis  a  loop-in  system,  but  there  are  occasions  when  this  system  becomes \ndif\ufb01cult  to  wire  satisfactorily.  A  typical  example  of  this  is  the  control \nof  centre  and  wall  lights  in  a  large  area.  Consider  the  layout  shown  in  \nFigure 2.16 and let us assume that ceiling points A and B are to be con-\ntrolled by one switch and wall lights C, D and E are each controlled by a \nseparate switch.\n\nThe  symbols  shown  are  BS  EN  60617  architectural  symbols.  The  X \n  indicates  a  one-way  switch  and  the \nrepresents  a  lighting  point,  the \nnumeral 4 shows how many switches are required. In this case, the dia-\ngram  shows  four  one-way  switches,  but  it  would  be  normal  to  install \na  four-gang  switch  (Figure  2.17)  rather  than  four  separate  one-way  \nswitches.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n25\n\nLampholder \n\nN \n\nBrown sleeve \n\nN \n\nL \nFrom  consumer \nunit \n\nTwo-way \nswitch \n\nC \n\nL2 \n\nL1 \n\nBrown  sleeve \n\nTwin  cable \nwith cpc \n\nThree-core cable \nwith  cpc \n\nConnector \n\nC \n\nL1 \n\nL2 \n\nThree-core  cable \nwith  cpc \n\nIntermediate \nswitch \n\nIndicates  alternative \nswitch position \n\n(cid:11)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:70)(cid:86)(cid:3)(cid:82)(cid:80)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:73)(cid:82)(cid:85)(cid:3)(cid:70)(cid:79)(cid:68)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:92)(cid:12)\n\n  FIGURE 2.15    Two-way and intermediate switching.\n\nThese  multiple-gang  switches  are,  however,  manufactured  as  a  bank  of \ntwo-way switches and so not all the terminals are needed.

For example, a feed would enter at, say, point A and loop \nto points C, D and E. Then switch cables would need to be run back from \neach of these points to the four-gang switch: complicated, congested and \nexpensive in cable.\n\nBringing a supply or feed to the four-gang switch and running single cables \nto each of the points to be controlled is far more sensible in all aspects \n(Figure 2.19).\n\nLight point B (Figure 2.16) would, of course, be wired from the lampholder \nterminals of point A.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n27\n\nLand N from  supply \n\nTo  wall  light C \n\nTo  wall  light  E \n\nN \n\nN \n\nN \n\nC \n\nL2 \n\nL1 \n\nC \n\nL2 \n\nL1 \n\nL1 \n\nL2 \n\nC \n\nL1 \n\nL2 \n\nC \n\nN \n\nN \n\nTo ceiling  lights A and  B \n\nTo  wall  light  D \n\nNeutrals from  each  light point terminate  in \na common  terminal.

The recommendations \nfor  such  circuits  are  given  in  Table  2.1.  These  radial  circuits  may  have \nboth fused and non-fused spurs (Figure 2.20).\n\n  Table 2.1   \n\n Coventional Circuit Arrangements for Radial Socket Outlet  \nCircuits\n\nProtective \nDevice Size\n\nProtective \nDevice Type\n\nMaximum Floor \nArea Served\n\nCable Size\n\n30 A or 32 A\n\n20 A\n\nany\n\nany\n\n75 m2\n\n50 m2\n\n4.0 m2\n\n2.5 m2\n\nNumber \nof Socket \nOutlets\n\nunlimited\n\nunlimited\n\n\f28\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nL \n\nN \n\nE \n\nNon-fused spur \n\n  FIGURE 2.20    Non-fused spur.\n\nStorage heater circuits\n\nThese, as discussed, are arranged to be energized during off-peak periods \nand it is usual to have a separate radial circuit for each heater, terminating \nin a fused connection unit.\n\nWater heater circuits\n\nMost small, over- or under-sink water heaters (less than 15 litres), storage \nor  instantaneous,  are  fed  from  fused  spurs  from  ring  circuits.  However, \nheaters over 15 l capacity and showers must be fed from their own indi-\nvidual radial circuits.\n\nCooker circuits\n\nThese  radial  circuits  feed  cooker  units  or  control  switches  from  which \nthe  cooking  appliances  are  supplied.  Cooker  units  are  available  with  or \nwithout socket outlets.\n\nIf the rating of the circuit is between 15 and 50 A, one radial may feed \ntwo  or  more  cooking  appliances  in  the  same  room.

The \n control switch must be within 2 m of any appliance and, in the case of \ntwo appliances, within 2 m of either one (Figure 2.21).\n\nRing \ufb01nal circuits\n\nGenerally  referred  to  as  ring  mains,  these  are  the  most  common \nmethod  of  supplying  BS  1363  socket  outlets  in  domestic  installations. \nThe general requirements for these conventional circuits are as follows.\n\n  1.   Provided  that  the  ring  does  not  serve  an  area  exceeding  100  m2, \nan  unlimited  number  of  sockets  may  be  fed  using  either  2.5  m2 \nPVC-insulated copper conductors or 1.5 m2 mineral-insulated copper \nconductors (MICCs) and protected by a 30 or 32 A device of any type.\n\n  2.   The number of fused spurs is unlimited.\n  3.   There may be as many non-fused spurs as there are points on the \n\nring.\n\n  4.   Each  non-fused  spur  may  feed  one  single-socket  outlet,  one \n double-socket  outlet  or  one  item  of  permanently  connected \nequipment.\n\nFigure 2.22 illustrates these points.\n\n\f30\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nNon-fused \nspur \n\nCable size not \nless than ring \n\nEquipment \n\nFused spur \n\nFused connection \nunit 13 A maximum \n\nJunction box \n\nL \n\nE \n\nN \n\nCable size not \nless than ring \n\nCable size not less \nthan  ring \n\nNon-fused \nspur \n\nNon-fused \nspur \n\n  FIGURE 2.22    Ring \ufb01nal circuit.\n\nCABLES\n\nLocal  protection \nand switching \n\nPermanently \nconnected \nequipment \n\nThere  are  a  vast  number  of  different  types  and  sizes  of  cable  and  con-\nductors available to cater for all applications. Those used in a domestic \nsituation, however, are limited to just a few.\n\nFixed wiring\n\nFixed wiring is the wiring that:\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)supplies  all  the  outlets  in  the  installation,  sockets,  lighting  point, \n\netc.\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)connects together detectors, sensors, etc., for security systems\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)supplies to telephone points and call systems.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n31\n\nPower and lighting\n\nThe cable used for these applications will predominately be of the \ufb02at twin \nwith cpc variety (6242 Y) or \ufb02at three-core with cpc (6243 Y) (Figure 2.23).\n\nThe use of steel or rigid PVC conduit containing single-core conductors is \nrare in domestic premises, with the exception of \ufb02ats or apartments with \nsolid \ufb02oors and ceilings and some older properties.\n\nAs  we  have  seen,  modern  6242  Y  cable  has  brown  and  blue  insulated \nconductors, the blue needing to be sleeved brown when used as a switch \nwire in lighting circuits. However, a 6242 Y cable is available with both \nconductors coloured brown. Of course, when used for switch drops, this \nobviates the need for brown sleeving.\n\nWhen underground supplies are required to supply remote garages, sheds, \nworkshops and garden lighting, 6242 Y cable can be used, provided it is \nprotected by running in galvanized conduit or is otherwise protected from \nmechanical  damage.  It  is,  however,  better  to  use  a  steel  wire  armoured \n(SWA) cable (Figure 2.24), as this type is speci\ufb01cally designed for harsh \napplications.\n\nAlternatively, PVC-sheathed MICCs can be used (Figure 2.25), although \nthis is expensive and requires special terminating tools.\n\nThe only other cables involved in the \ufb01xed wiring would be the single-core \nline, neutral and earth conductors at the main intake (tails) and bonding \nconductors.  All  are  categorized  as  6491  X,  and  the  line  and  neutral  are \n\nSheath \n\nInsulation \n\nNeutral \ncpc \nUne \n\nUne \ncpc \nUne \n\nUne \n\n6242Y \n\n6243Y \n\n  FIGURE 2.23    Flat pro\ufb01le cable.\n\n\f32\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nOuter PVC sheath \n\nSteel wire armour (SWA) \n\nInner PVC sheath \n\nInsulation \n\nLive conductors \n\n  FIGURE 2.24    Steel wire armoured cable (SWA).\n\nPVC oversheath \n\nCopper sheath \n\nCopper conductors \n\nMagnesium oxide \npowder insulation \n\n  FIGURE 2.25    Mineral insulated cable.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n33\n\nPVC-sheathed (usually grey) as well as insulated. The earth conductors, \n collectively called protective conductors, are green and yellow.\n\nSecurity\n\nIn this case, the cable used to link sensors and detectors will depend on \nthe  system,  but  is  usually  multicore  PVC-sheathed  and  insulated  with \nstranded conductors typically 7/0.2 (i.e. seven strands of 0.2 mm diameter \nwire).\n\nFire alarms\n\nAn  increasing  number  of  homes  are  now  having  \ufb01re  alarm  systems \ninstalled,  very  often  linked  to  a  security  system.  The  cable  used  to  \nlink  the  sensors  is  usually  FP  200  or  Firetuff  (both  of  which  are  \ufb01re \nretardant).\n\nTelephone and call systems\n\nThese employ similar cable to that used for security systems.\n\nFlexible cables\n\nFlexible  cables  are  used  to  make  the  \ufb01nal  connection  from  the  \ufb01xed   \nwiring  to  accessories  or  equipment  either  directly  or  via  plugs.  The \n conductors  of  these  cables  are  made  of  many  strands  of  thin  wire,  \ngiving the \ufb02exible quality with which we are familiar. The number and \nsize  of  these  strands  depend  on  the  overall  size  of  the  conductor,  for \n example, a 0.5 mm2 conductor comprises 16 strands of 0.2 mm diam-\neter  wire,  whereas  a  2.5  mm2  conductor  has  50  strands  of  0.25  mm \ndiameter wire.\n\nThere are a variety of \ufb02exible cables used in a domestic situation, varying \nfrom 0.5 to 2.5 mm2 (4.0 mm2 would hardly ever be used). The choice \nof cable type and size will depend on the appliance or equipment and the \nenvironmental  conditions.  So,  for  example,  pendant  drops  from  ceiling \nroses to lampholders would be wired with circular general-purpose PVC \n\n\f34\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\ncables, whereas heat-resistant PVC or butyl rubber \ufb02ex would be used for \nconnection to heating appliances.\n\nWIRING SYSTEMS AND INSTALLATION METHODS\n\nThere are two basic wiring systems used in domestic premises:\n\n  1.   Flat  twin  and  three-core  cable  (6242  Y  and  6243  Y),  clipped \nto  the  building  structure,  run  in  the  \ufb02oor,  wall  and  ceiling  voids \nand,  for  added  protection  when  wiring  is  run  surface,  enclosed  in \nmini-trunking.\n\n  2.   Single-core cables (6491 X), enclosed in steel or rigid PVC conduit or \n\nin skirting and/or architrave trunking.\n\nThe  \ufb02at  sheathed  cables  are  more  likely  to  be  used  with  the  mini- \ntrunking  systems,  which  are  not  usually  continuous  throughout  the \nwhole installation.\n\nIncluded  in  the  trunking  systems  is  the  pre-wired  \ufb02exible  conduit \n system,  which  comprises  a  \ufb02at  pro\ufb01le,  \ufb02exible,  compartmentalized \n conduit with PVC singles included (Figure 2.26). Conduit systems, pre-\nwired or otherwise, are usually installed where there are no building voids \nsuch as \ufb02ats with solid \ufb02oors and ceilings.\n\n  FIGURE 2.26    Pre-wired \ufb02exible conduit system.\n\nInstalling \ufb02at twin and three-core cables\n\nBefore  we  begin  to  examine  the  methods  of  installing  \ufb02at  pro\ufb01le  PVC \ncables, it is important to be aware of certain constraints.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n35\n\nWhen a cable is bent, the conductor insulation on the inside of the bend \nwill be compressed and that on the outside stretched. Consequently, cable \nbends should be such that no damage to insulation is caused. For \ufb02at pro-\n\ufb01le cables the minimum bending radius is three times the cable width for \ncables up to 10 mm2 and four times for 16 mm2 (Figure 2.27 and Table 2.2).\n\nCables should be run without twists, and so should be removed from the \ncable  drum  in  the  same  way  as  they  were  wound  on.  They  should  not \nbe uncoiled, which would, of course, create twists. Flat pro\ufb01le cables are \ndesigned  to  be  clipped  \ufb02at  not  on  edge,  as  this  may  lead  to   damage  by  \n compressing the live conductor\u2019s insulation onto the bare cpc (Figure 2.28).\n\no \n\nMinimum bending radius \n(40 for 16mm2) \n\n3D \n\n  FIGURE 2.27    Minimum bending radius.\n\n  Table 2.2    Cable Bending Radii\n\n6242 Y\n\n6243 Y\n\nCable Size\n\nCable Width\n\nBend Radius\n\nCable Size Cable Width\n\nBend Radius\n\n1.0 mm2\n\n7.6 mm\n\n22.8 mm\n\n1.0 mm2\n\n9.9 mm\n\n29.7 mm\n\n1.5 mm2\n\n8.6 mm\n\n25.8 mm\n\n1.5 mm2\n\n11.4 mm\n\n34.2 mm\n\n2.5 mm2\n\n10.2 mm\n\n30.6 mm\n\n4.0 mm2\n\n11.8 mm\n\n35.4 mm\n\n6.0 mm2\n\n13.4 mm\n\n40.2 mm\n\n10.0 mm2\n\n17.2 mm\n\n51.6 mm\n\n16.0 mm2\n\n19.4 mm\n\n77.6 mm\n\n\f36\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nDownward force crushing \nLand N against cpc \n\nCable clip \n\n  FIGURE 2.28   \n\nIncorrect cable clipping.\n\n  Important Note \n\nWhere cables are run where there is a risk of premature collapse due to \ufb01re eg ceiling \nvoids, the means of support must NOT be combustible, so cable clips etc will need to \nbe metallic.\n\nProblems of embrittlement and cracking of PVC-sheathing and insulation \ncan occur if PVC cable comes into contact with polystyrene. A reaction \ntakes place between the two materials such that the plasticizer used in the \nmanufacture of the PVC covering will migrate onto the polystyrene, leav-\ning the cable in a rigid condition. If the cable is disturbed at a later date, \nthe PVC is likely to crack, with the obvious consequences. Typical of this \nsituation is the use of polystyrene granules, generally in older properties, \nas thermal insulation.\n\nWith these constraints in mind, let us now consider installation methods \nand techniques.\n\nThe IET Wiring Regulations (BS 7671) give details of various installation \nmethods. Those appropriate to domestic installations are known as meth-\nods A, B, C, 100, 102, 102, and 103 (Figures 2.29, 2.30 and 2.31 (a), (b), \n(c) and (d) illustrate these methods).\n\nThe \ufb01rst-\ufb01x\n\nThis  is  the  term  used  to  describe  the  initial  installation  of  cables  and \n associated  accessories,  prior  to  ceilings  being  boarded,  walls  being  plas-\ntered and \ufb02oors being laid. Before cables are drawn in, it is, perhaps, best \nto install all of the metal knock-out (KO) boxes.\n\n\fMasonryor \nwooden \nsurface \n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n37\n\nSheathed single core cables \n\nFlat sheathed cable \n\nMasonry \n\n  FIGURE 2.29    Method C.\n\nThose used for lighting circuits can usually be \ufb01xed directly to brick or \nblock  surfaces  without  \u2018chasing  in\u2019,  as  they  are  designed  to  be  plaster \ndepth. All other boxes must be chased in such that their front edge will be \n\ufb02ush with the \ufb01nished plaster line (Figure 2.32).\n\nAt  \ufb01rst-\ufb01x  stage,  it  is  common  practice  to  hold  these  metal  boxes  \nin  place  with  galvanized  plasterboard  nails  rather  than  screws  and  wall \nplugs,  as  the  rendering  and  \ufb01nal  plaster  will  prevent  the  box  from  ever  \nmoving.\n\n\f38\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nMasonry or \nwooden  surface \n\n(cid:2)\nMasonry \n\n  FIGURE 2.30    Method B.\n\nWhere cables enter KO boxes, holes should have grommets installed. In \ngeneral, it is usual to either clip cables directly to a surface and give added \nprotection from danger by the plasterer\u2019s trowel by covering the cable in \nPVC or metal Top-Hat section, or enclose it in oval conduit.\n\nThere  are,  however,  occasions  when  a  speci\ufb01cation  demands  that  all \ncable runs are chased in to achieve full plaster cover. Also at \ufb01rst-\ufb01x stage \nand before cables are run, it is usual to drill or notch joints. Great care \nmust be taken when carrying out such work as the strength of joints may \n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n39\n\nOuterwall \n\nRoom \n\n(a) \n\nThermal insulation \n\nJoist \n\n(b) \n\nJoist \n\n(c) \n\n100mm \n\nExceeding \n100mm \n\nCeiling \n\nThermal insulation \n\nCeiling \n\n  FIGURE 2.31   \n\n(a) Method A, (b) Method 100, (c) Method 101.

Those that are installed in walls or in partitions \nat a depth of less than 50 mm should be run direct to the accessory either \nvertically  or  horizontally.

Supporting distances for surface conduits, if used in \ndomestic situations, are shown in Table 2.4.\n\nFor a \u2018\ufb01rst-\ufb01x\u2019 on a concealed conduit system, crampets would hold the \nconduit in place until the render and plaster were applied (Figure 2.37).\n\n  Table 2.4    Supports for Conduits\n\nMaximum Distance Between Supports\n\nMetal\n\nConduit diameter\n\nHorizontal\n\n20\u201325 mm\n\n1.75 m\n\nVertical\n\n2.0 m\n\nPVC\n\nHorizontal\n\n1.5 m\n\nVertical\n\n1.75 m\n\n\f44\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nConduit \n\nCrampet \n\n  FIGURE 2.37    Crampet \ufb01xing.\n\nMasonry \n\nFemale conduit bush \n\nMale conduit bush \n\nIncorrect \n\nIncorrect \n\nMale \n\nIncorrect \nFemale \n\n  FIGURE 2.38    Conduit termination.\n\nConduit systems should be complete and continuous throughout and so \nentries to KO boxes will be via male or female bushes (Figure 2.38).\n\nWhatever system is used, it is sensible to leave plenty of cable/conductor \nat each outlet at \ufb01rst-\ufb01x stage (150 mm is reasonable).\n\nThe second-\ufb01x\n\nFitting  accessories  is  the  nice,  clean  part!  It  is  at  this  point  that  some \ndegree of testing could be carried out to determine if any damage to cables \nhas occurred since the \ufb01rst-\ufb01x was completed (see Chapter 6). Clearly, in \norder to \ufb01t accessories, cable sheaths and/or insulation must be removed. \nThis is the subject of terminations.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n45\n\nTerminations\n\nGreat  care  must  be  taken  when  terminating  cables  and  conductors  in \norder to avoid accidental damage from terminating tools.\n\nPreparing \ufb02at pro\ufb01le cables\n\nIn order to terminate \ufb02at pro\ufb01le cables, the outer sheath must be removed. \nThere are two ways of achieving this, using a knife or using the cable cpc:\n\n  1.   The knife is used to slice the sheathing lengthways and then to cut off \n\nthe surplus (Figure 2.39).\n\n  2.   The cable end is split with a pair of cutters and the cpc exposed and \nhooked out. This may be held by pliers and dragged backwards along  \nthe cable, splitting the sheath. The surplus is cut off (Figure 2.40).\n\nCut \n\nDanger of slicing \ninsulation \n\n  FIGURE 2.39    Terminating \ufb02at cable.\n\nPul! to split \ncable sheath \n\n  FIGURE 2.40    Terminating \ufb02at cable.\n\n\f46\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\nGrommet \n\nMinimum sheathing \ninside enclosure \n\n  FIGURE 2.41    Entry to KO box.\n\nKO box or accessory \nenclosure \n\nSheathing should be removed close to the entry to an accessory, but must \nnot be removed outside the accessory enclosure. Too much sheath left on \na cable inside an enclosure makes the whole termination process dif\ufb01cult \nas space is at a premium (Figure 2.41).\n\nWith \ufb02exible cables, the process of sheath removal is probably best using \na knife. Here, the sheathing is very carefully cut around the cable at the \ndesired length, until the colours of the cores are just visible. The sheath \ncan then usually be pulled off. Care must be taken to avoid any cutting of \nthe conductor insulation.\n\nPreparing mineral-insulated cables\n\nAlthough  mineral-insulated  cable  installations  are  uncommon  in \n domestic installations, it is worth taking a brief look at the termination \nof such cable. Special tools are required to strip the outer sheath and to \nassemble all the respective parts of the termination.\n\nFirst, the outer sheath is removed to the required length (care being taken \nto  avoid  any  moisture  being  absorbed  by  the  magnesium  oxide  powder \ninsulation). Then, the various parts of the termination assembly are slid \nonto the cable, compressed and screwed together (Figure 2.42).\n\nPreparing steel wire armoured cable\n\nIn  a  domestic  situation,  probably  the  only  time  this  cable  would  be \nused  would  be  for  supplies  to  garages,  workshops,  garden  lighting,  etc. \nFigure 2.43 shows the component parts of an SWA cable termination.\n\n\fDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n47\n\nCable  Compression \n\nolive \n\nGland nut \n\nGland \n\n  FIGURE 2.42    Mineral cable termination.\n\nDisc \n\nScrew-on pot  Sieeve \n\nArmour \n\nOuter sheath \n\nInner sheath \n\nCompression \n\nGland  nut  sleeve \n\nGland \n\n  FIGURE 2.43    SWA termination.\n\nTerminal \n\nCorrect \n\nIncorrect \n\n  FIGURE 2.44    Termination technique.\n\nOnce sheathing has been removed from \ufb02at pro\ufb01le cables, \ufb02exible cords \nand mineral-insulated or SWA cables have been prepared, the next stage \nis  to  strip  the  insulation  from  the  conductors.  This  must  also  be  done \nwith the utmost care. Conductors should not be scored nor have strands \nremoved. Only the minimum amount of insulation should be removed to \nenable the conductor to be housed in its terminal (Figure 2.44).\n\nWhen single small conductors are to be housed in large terminals, it is \nusual to double over the conductor to ensure a good contact with the ter-\nminal screw (Figure 2.45).\n\n\f48\n\nDomestic Electrical Installations\n\n  FIGURE 2.45    Termination technique.\n\nDo not twist conductors together when terminating; it strains them and \nmakes disconnection and reconnection before and after testing very dif\ufb01-\ncult.

Touching  live  parts  of  equipment  or  systems  that  are  intended \n\nto be live.\n\n\fThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding  51\n\n  2.   Touching conductive parts which are not meant to be live, but which \n\nhave become live due to a fault.\n\nThe  conductive  parts  associated  with  condition  (2)  can  either  be \n metalwork  of  electrical  equipment  and  accessories  (Class  I)  and  that  of \nelectrical wiring systems (e.g. metal conduit and trunking), called exposed \nconductive  parts,  or  other  metalwork  (e.g.  pipes,  radiators  and  exposed \nstructural steelwork), called extraneous conductive parts.\n\nBASIC PROTECTION\n\nHow can we prevent danger to persons and livestock from contact with \nintentionally live parts? Clearly, we must minimize the risk of such con-\ntact and this can be achieved by basic protection, which is:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)insulating any live parts, or\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)ensuring  any  uninsulated  live  parts  are  housed  in  suitable  enclo-\n\nsures and/or are behind barriers.\n\nThe use of a residual current device (RCD) cannot prevent this contact, \nbut it can be used as additional protection to any of the other measures \ntaken, provided that its rating, I(cid:54)n, is 30 mA or less.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  RCDs  are  not  the  panacea  for  all  electrical  \nills;  they  can  malfunction,  but  they  are  a  valid  and  effective  back-up \nto  the  other  methods.  They  must  not  be  used  as  the  sole  means  of  \nprotection.\n\nFAULT PROTECTION\n\nHow can we protect against shock from contact with unintentionally live, \nexposed  or  extraneous  conductive  parts  whilst  touching  earth,  or  from \ncontact  between  live  exposed  and/or  extraneous  conductive  parts?  The \nmost common method is by protective earthing, protective equipotential \nbonding and automatic disconnection in case of a fault.\n\nAll  extraneous  conductive  parts  are  joined  together  by  main  protective \nbonding conductors and connected to the main earthing terminal, and all \n\n\f52\n\nThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding \n\nexposed conductive parts are connected to the main earthing terminal by \nthe circuit protective conductors (cpcs). Add to this overcurrent protective \ndevices that will operate fast enough when a fault occurs and the risk of \nsevere electric shock is signi\ufb01cantly reduced.\n\nWHAT IS EARTH AND WHY AND HOW DO WE  \nCONNECT TO IT?\n\nThe thin layer of material which covers our planet \u2013 rock, clay, chalk or \nwhatever \u2013 is what we in the world of electricity refer to as earth. So, why \ndo we need to connect anything to it? After all, it is not as if earth is a \ngood conductor.\n\nIt  might  be  wise  at  this  stage  to  investigate  potential  difference  (PD). \nA  PD  is  exactly  what  it  says  it  is:  a  difference  in  potential  (volts).  \nIn  this  way,  two  conductors  having  PDs  of,  say,  20  and  26  V  have  a \nPD  between  them  of  26  \u2013  20  =  6  V.  The  original  PDs  (i.e.  20  and  26 \nV) are the PDs between 20 V and 0 V and 26 V and0 V. So where does  \nthis 0 V or zero potential come from? The simple answer is, in our case, \nthe  earth.  The  de\ufb01nition  of  earth  is,  therefore,  the  conductive  mass  of \nearth,  whose  electric  potential  at  any  point  is  conventionally  taken  as \nzero.\n\nThus, if we connect a voltmeter between a live part (e.g. the line conduc-\ntor of a socket outlet) and earth, we may read 230 V; the conductor is at \n230 V and the earth at zero. The earth provides a path to complete the \ncircuit. We would measure nothing at all if we connected our voltmeter \nbetween, say, the positive 12 V terminal of a car battery and earth, as in \nthis case the earth plays no part in any circuit.\n\nFigure 3.2 illustrates this difference.\n\nSo,  a  person  in  an  installation  touching  a  live  part  whilst  standing  on \nthe earth would take the place of the voltmeter and could suffer a severe \nelectric shock. Remember that the accepted lethal level of shock current \npassing through a person is only 50 mA or 1/20 A. The same situation \nwould  arise  if  the  person  were  touching  a  faulty  appliance  and  a  gas  or \nwater pipe (Figure 3.3).\n\n\fThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding  53\n\nZe \n\nZe \n\nOV \n\nL \n\nL \n\n230 V \n\nZe \n\nOne phase \nof supply \ntransformer \n\nZe \n\nN \n\nEarth \n\nOV \n\nN \n\nZe \n\n12V \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nv \n\nZe \n\nEarth \n\n  FIGURE 3.2   \n\n(a) Earth path, (b) No earth path.\n\nOne method of providing some measure of protection against these effects \nis, as we have seen, to join together (bond) all metallic parts and connect \nthem to earth. This ensures that all metalwork in a healthy installation \nis at or near 0 V and, under fault conditions, all metalwork will rise to \na similar potential. So, simultaneous contact with two such metal parts \nwould not result in a dangerous shock, as there would be no signi\ufb01cant \nPD between them.\n\n\f54\n\nThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding \n\nL \n\nSupply \n\n230V \n\nZe \n\nN \n\nOV \n\nL \n\n:g \n\" Ci; \nE \n\" <J) \n5 \n\u00fc \nN \n\nN \n\nZe \n\nEarth \n\nZe \n\nFault \n\nZe \n\nZe \n\nGas \npipe \n\nGasmain \n\n  FIGURE 3.3    Shock path.\n\nUnfortunately,  as  mentioned,  earth  itself  is  not  a  good  conductor,  \nunless  it  is  very  wet.  Therefore,  it  presents  a  high  resistance  to  \nthe  \ufb02ow  of  fault  current.  This  resistance  is  usually  enough  to  restrict \nfault  current  to  a  level  well  below  that  of  the  rating  of  the  protective \ndevice,  leaving a faulty circuit uninterrupted. Clearly this is an unhealthy \nsituation.\n\nIn all but the most rural areas, consumers can connect to a metallic earth \nreturn conductor, which is ultimately connected to the earthed neutral of \nthe supply. This, of course, presents a low-resistance path for fault cur-\nrents to operate the protection.\n\nIn  summary,  connecting  metalwork  to  earth  places  that  metal  at  or \nnear zero potential and bonding between metallic parts puts such parts \nat  a  similar  potential  even  under  fault  conditions.  Add  to  this  a  low- \nresistance earth fault return path, which will enable the circuit protection \nto operate very fast, and we have signi\ufb01cantly reduced the risk of electric \nshock.\n\n\fThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding  55\n\nEarth fault loop impedance\n\nAs we have just seen, circuit protection should operate in the event of a \nfault to earth. The speed of operation of the protective device is of extreme \nimportance and will depend on the impedance of the earth fault loop path.\n\nFigure 3.4 shows the three paths. Starting at the point of the fault, the \npath comprises:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) the circuit protective conductor (cpc)\n(cid:402)(cid:3) the consumer\u2019s earthing terminal and earthing conductor\n(cid:402)(cid:3) the return path, either metallic or earth itself\n(cid:402)(cid:3) the earthed neutral of the supply transformer\n(cid:402)(cid:3) the transformer winding\n(cid:402)(cid:3) the line conductor from the transformer to the fault.\n\nEarth fault loop path \n\nL \n\nProtective device \n\nal \nECl \n~ c: \no  . \n\"0 \n_ \n!J)  c: \n~ .~ \nt= \n\nEarthed \nneutral \n\nFault current I \n\nExposed conductive part \n\nTN-C-S (Ze=0.3SQ) \n\n(cid:49)\n\nZe \n\nPEN conductor \nTN-S (Ze = 0.8 Q) \n(cid:49)\n\nLink \n(For TN-C-S) \n\nMET \n\nMetallic return path \nCable sheath \n\nE \n\nThe earthing conductor \n\nFault \n\ncpc \n\nMassofearth \n\nT.T \n\nReturn path \n\n  FIGURE 3.4    Earth fault loop path.\n\n\f56\n\nThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding \n\nZe \n\nExposed \nconductive \npart \n\nZe \n\nZe \n\nTransformer \n\nL \n\nZe \n\nE \n\nZ, = Z. + (R,  + R2 ) \n\nWhere:  Z, = totalloop impedence \n\nZ. = extemal loop impedence \nR,  = resistance of the circuit line conductor \nR2  = resistance of the circuit cpc. \n\n  FIGURE 3.5    Simpli\ufb01ed earth fault loop path.\n\nFigure 3.5 is a simpli\ufb01ed version of the loop path.\n\nFrom  Figure  3.5,  we  can  see  that  the  total  earth  fault  loop  impedance \n(Zs)  is  made  up  of  the  impedance  external  to  the  installation  (Ze),  the \n resistance  of  the  circuit  line  conductor  (R1)  and  that  of  the  circuit  cpc \n(R2), i.e.\n\nZs = Ze + R1 + R2\n\nwe also have, from Ohm\u2019s law, the value of the fault current that would \n\ufb02ow from\n\nI =\n\nU0\n\nZs\n\nwhere U0 is the nominal voltage to earth (230 V).\n\nDetermining the value of total loop impedance Zs\n\nThe IET Regulations require that when the general characteristics of an \ninstallation are assessed, the loop impedance Ze external to the  installation  \n\n\fThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding  57\n\nshall  be  ascertained.  This  may  be  measured  in  existing  installations \nusing a line-to-earth loop impedance tester. However, when a building is \nonly at the drawing-board stage, it is clearly impossible to make such a \n measurement. In this case, we have three methods available to assess the \nvalue of Ze.\n\n  1.   Determine it from details (if available) of the supply transformer, the \n\nmain distribution cable and the proposed service cable.\n\n  2.   Measure it from the supply intake position of an adjacent building \n\nwhich has service cable of similar size and length to that proposed.\n\n  3.   Use the maximum likely values issued by the supply authority, as \n\nfollows:\n(a)  TT system: 21 (cid:49) maximum\n(b)  TN-S system: 0.8 (cid:49) maximum\n(c)  TN-C-S system: 0.35 (cid:49) maximum.\n\nMethod 1 will be dif\ufb01cult for anyone except engineers. Method 3 can, in \nsome cases, result in pessimistically large cable sizes. Method 2, if it is \npossible to use it, will give a closer and more realistic estimation of Ze. \nHowever, if in any doubt, use Method 3.\n\nHaving  established  a  value  for  Ze,  it  is  now  necessary  to  determine \nthe impedance of that part of the loop path internal to the installation. \nThis  is,  as  we  have  seen,  the  resistance  of  the  line  conductor  plus  the \n\n  Table 3.2    Resistance of Copper Conductors in m(cid:49)/m at 20\u00b0C\n\nConductor (mm2)\n\nResistance (m(cid:49))\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n10.0\n\n16.0\n\n25.0\n\n35.0\n\n18.1\n\n12.1\n\n7.41\n\n4.61\n\n3.08\n\n1.83\n\n1.15\n\n0.727\n\n0.524\n\n \n \n \n\f58\n\nThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding \n\n resistance  of  the  cpc  (i.e.  R1  +  R2).  Resistances  of  copper  conductors \nmay  be  found  from  manufacturers\u2019  information,  which  gives  values \nof  resistance/metre  for  copper  and  aluminium  conductors  at  20\u00b0C  in  \nm(cid:49)/m.  Table  3.2  gives  resistance  values  for  copper  conductors  up  to \n35 mm2.\n\nSo, a 25.0 mm2 line conductor with a 4.0 mm2 cpc has R1 = 0.727 m(cid:49) \nand R2 = 4.61 m(cid:49), giving R1 + R2 = 0.727 + 4.61 = 5.337 m(cid:49)/m. So, \nhaving established a value for R1 + R2, we must now multiply it by the \nlength of the run and divide by 1000 (the values given are in milli-ohms \nper metre). However, this \ufb01nal value is based on a temperature of 20\u00b0C, \nbut when the conductor is fully loaded, its temperature will increase. In \norder  to  determine  the  value  of  resistance  at  conductor-operating  tem-\nperature, a multiplier is used. This multiplier, applied to the 20\u00b0C value \nof resistance, is 1.2 for 70\u00b0C PVC cables.\n\nHence, for a 20 m length of 70\u00b0C PVC-insulated 16.0 mm2 line conductor \nwith a 4.0 mm2 cpc, the value of R1 + R2 would be\n\nR1 + R2 = [(1.15 + 4.61) \u00d7 20 \u00d7 1.2]/1000 = 0.138 (cid:49)\n\nWe are now in a position to determine the total earth fault loop imped-\nance Zs from\n\nZs = Ze + R1 + R2\n\nAs  mentioned,  this  value  of  Zs  should  be  as  low  as  possible  to  allow \nenough  fault  current  to  \ufb02ow  to  operate  the  protection  as  quickly  as \n possible.  The  IET  Regulations  give  maximum  values  of  loop  imped-\nance for different sizes and types of protection for (1). \ufb01nal circuits not \nexceeding  32  A  and  (2).  distribution  circuits  and  \ufb01nal  circuits  exceed-\ning  32  A.  Provided  that  the  actual  calculated  values  do  not  exceed  \nthose tabulated, \ufb01nal circuits (1) will disconnect under earth fault con-\nditions  in  0.4  s  or  less,  and  distribution  and  \ufb01nal  circuits  (2)  in  5  s  \nor  less.  The  reasoning  behind  these  different  times  is  based  on  the \ntime  that  a  faulty  circuit  can  reasonably  be  left  uninterrupted  and \nis  based  on  the  probable  chances  of  someone  being  in  contact  with  \nexposed  or  extraneous  conductive  parts  at  the  precise  moment  that  a \nfault develops.\n\n\fThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding  59\n\n  Example 3.1 \n\nLet\u2019s have a look at a typical example of a shower circuit run in an 18 m \nlength of 6.0 mm2 (6242 Y) twin 70\u00b0C thermosetting cable with cpc, and \nprotected by a 30 A BS 3036 semi-enclosed rewirable fuse. A 6.0 mm2 \ntwin cable has a 2.5 mm2 cpc. We will also assume that the external loop \nimpedance Ze is measured at 0.27 (cid:49). Will there be a shock risk if a line-\nto-earth fault occurs?\n\nThe total loop impedance Zs = Ze + R1 + R2 and we are given Ze = 0.27 (cid:49).  \nFor  a  6.0  mm2  line  conductor  with  a  2.5  mm2  cpc,  R1  +  R2  is  10.49 \nm(cid:49)/m.  Hence,  with  a  multiplier  of  1.2  for  70\u00b0  C  PVC,  the  total  \nR1 + R2 = 18 \u00d7 10.49 \u00d7 1.2/1000 = 0.23 (cid:49). Therefore, Zs = 0.27 + 0.23 =  \n0.50  (cid:49).  This  is  less  than  the  1.04  (cid:49)  maximum  given  in  the  IET \n Regulations for a 30 A BS 3036 fuse. Consequently, the protection will \ndisconnect the circuit in less than 0.4 s.\n\nRESIDUAL CURRENT DEVICES\n\nWe have seen how very important the total earth loop impedance Zs is in \nthe reduction of shock risk. However, in TT systems where the mass of \nearth is part of the fault path, the maximum values of Zs given in the IET \nRegulations may be hard to satisfy. Added to this, climatic conditions will \nalter the resistance of the earth in such a way that Ze may be satisfactory \nin wet weather, but not in very dry conditions.\n\nThe  regulations  recommend,  therefore,  that  the  preferred  method  of \nearth  fault  protection  for  installations  in  TT  systems  be  achieved  by \nRCDs,  such  that  the  product  of  its  residual  operating  current  and  the \nloop impedance will not exceed a \ufb01gure of 50 V. Residual current breakers \n(RCBs), residual current circuit breakers (RCCBs) and RCDs are one and \nthe same thing. Modern developments in CB (circuit breaker), RCD and \nconsumer unit design now make it easy to protect any individual circuit \nwith a combined CB/RCD (RCBO), making the use of split-load boards \nunnecessary.\n\nIn  domestic  premises  the  use  of  30  mA  RCDs  is  required  for  the  pro-\ntection of all socket outlets rated at not more than 32 A, for all circuits \n\n\f60\n\nThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding \n\nsupplying  luminaires,  for  all  circuits  in  a  bath  or  shower  room  and  for \ncables embedded in walls and partitions at a depth of less than 50 mm. \nSocket  outlets  not  intended for general  use, for  example those provided \nfor non-portable equipment such as freezers, etc., are exempt from this \nrequirement, provided they are suitably labelled or identi\ufb01ed (Table 3.3).\n\n  Table 3.3 \n\n30 mA\n\u2022   All socket outlets rated at not more than 32 A general use.\n\u2022   Mobile equipment rated at not more than 32 A for use outdoors.\n\u2022   All circuits in domestic premises supplying luminaires.\n\u2022   All circuits in a bath/shower room.\n\u2022   Preferred for all circuits in a TT system.\n\u2022   All cables installed less than 50 mm from the surface of a wall or partition unless they \nare adequately mechanically protected or have earthed screening or armouring, and \nalso at any depth if the construction of the wall or partition includes metallic parts.\n\n\u2022   In zones 0, 1 and 2 of swimming pool locations.\n\u2022   All circuits in a location containing saunas, etc.\n\u2022   Socket outlet \ufb01nal circuits not exceeding 32 A in agricultural locations.\n\u2022   Circuits supplying Class II equipment in restrictive conductive locations.\n\u2022   Each socket outlet in caravan parks and marinas and \ufb01nal circuit for houseboats.\n\u2022   All socket-outlet circuits rated not more than 32 A for show stands, etc.\n\u2022   All socket-outlet circuits rated not more than 32 A for construction sites (where reduced \n\nlow voltage, etc., is not used).\n\n\u2022   All socket outlets supplying equipment outside mobile or transportable units.\n\u2022   All circuits in caravans.\n\u2022   All circuits in circuses, etc.\n\u2022   A circuit supplying Class II heating equipment for \ufb02oor and ceiling  \n\nheating systems.\n\n500 mA\n\u2022   Any circuit supplying one or more socket outlets of rating exceeding 32 A, on a \n\n construction site.\n\n300 mA\n\u2022   At the origin of a temporary supply to circuses, etc.\n\u2022   Where there is a risk of \ufb01re due to storage of combustible materials.\n\u2022   All circuits (except socket outlets) in agricultural locations.\n\n100 mA\n\u2022   Socket outlets of rating exceeding 32 A in agricultural locations.\nWhere Loop Impedances are too high, RCD ratings can be calculated.\n\n\fThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding  61\n\nBONDING: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n\nBy now, we should know why bonding is necessary. The next question is \nto what extent bonding should be carried out. This is, perhaps, answered \nbest by means of question and answer examples.\n\n  1.   Do I need to bond the kitchen hot and cold taps and a metal sink \n\ntogether?\n  The IET Regulations do not require this bonding to be carried out in \ndomestic kitchens/utility rooms, etc.\n\n  2.   Do  I  have  to  bond  radiators  in  a  premises  to,  say,  metal-clad \n\nswitches or socket outlets?\n  Supplementary bonding is only necessary when extraneous conduc-\ntive  parts  are  simultaneously  accessible  with  exposed  conductive \nparts  and  when  the  disconnection  time  for  the  circuit  concerned \ncannot be achieved. In these circumstances, the bonding  conductor \nshould  have  a  resistance  R  <  50/Ia,  where  R  =  resistance  of \n supplementary bonding conductor, 50 = touch voltage of 50 V and \nIa = current causing operation of protection.\n\n  3.   Do I need to bond metal window frames?\n\n  In general, no! Apart from the fact that most window frames will not \nintroduce a potential from anywhere, the part of the window most \nlikely to be touched is the opening portion, to which it would not \nbe practicable to bond. There may be a case for the bonding of patio \ndoors, which could be considered earthy with rain running from the \nlower portion to the earth. However, once again, the part most likely \nto  be  touched  is  the  sliding  section,  to  which  it  is  not  possible  to \nbond. In any case, there would need to be another simultaneously \naccessible part to warrant considering any bonding.\n\n  4.   What about bonding in bathrooms?\n\n  This is dealt with in detail in Chapter 4.\n\n  5.   What size of bonding conductors should I use?\n\n  Main protective bonding conductors should be not less than half the \nsize of the earthing conductor, subject to a minimum of 6.0 mm2 or, \nwhere PME (TN-C-S) conditions are present, 10.0 mm2. For exam-\nple, most new domestic installations now have a 16.0 mm2 earthing \nconductor,  so  all  main  bonding  will  be  in  10.0  mm2.  Supplemen-\ntary  bonding  conductors  are  subject  to  a  minimum  of  2.5  mm2  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f62\n\nThe Importance of Earthing and Bonding \n\nif mechanically protected or 4.0 mm2 if not. However, if these bond-\ning  conductors  are  connected  to  exposed  conductive  parts,  they \nmust be the same size as the cpc connected to the exposed conduc-\ntive part (once again subject to the minimum sizes mentioned). It \nis sometimes dif\ufb01cult to protect a bonding conductor mechanically \nthroughout  its  length,  especially  at  terminations,  so  it  is  perhaps \nbetter to use 4.0 mm2 as the minimum size.\n\n  6.

In fact, a serious electrical overcur-\nrent, left uninterrupted for too long, can cause distortion of conductors \nand degradation of insulation. Both of these effects are considered to be \nmechanical damage.\n\nHowever, let us start by considering the ways of preventing mechanical \ndamage caused by physical impact and the like.\n\nCable construction\n\nAs we have seen in Chapter 2, a cable comprises one or more conductors, \neach covered with an insulating material. This insulation provides protec-\ntion from shock by bodily contact with live parts and prevents the passage of \nleakage currents between conductors. Clearly, insulation is very important \nand, in itself, should be protected from damage. This may be achieved by \ncovering the insulated conductors with a protective sheathing during manu-\nfacture or by enclosing them in conduit or trunking at the installation stage.\n\nThe type of sheathing chosen and/or the installation method will depend \non the environment in which the cable is to be installed. For example, in \nan environment subject to mechanical damage, metal conduit with poly-\nvinyl chloride (PVC) singles or mineral-insulated cable would be used in \npreference to PVC-sheathed cable clipped direct.\n\nProtection against corrosion\n\nMechanical damage to cable sheaths and the metalwork of wiring systems \ncan occur through corrosion, and so care must be taken to choose corro-\nsion-resistant  materials  and  to  avoid  contact  between  dissimilar  metals \nin damp situations.\n\nProtection against thermal effects\n\nThe IET Regulations basically require commonsense decisions regarding \nthe placing of \ufb01xed equipment, so that surrounding materials are not at \n\n\fProtection\n\n69\n\nrisk  from  damage  by  heat.  Added  to  these  requirements  is  the  need  to \nprotect persons and livestock from burns by guarding parts of equipment \nliable to excessive temperatures.\n\nDamaged cables, faulty equipment etc can cause dangerous arcing which \nin turn can cause \ufb01res. The IET Regulations recommend the installation \nof Arc Fault Detection Devices (AFDDs) to mitigate against such arcing. \nFor domestic premises they would be best installed on socket outlet \ufb01nal \ncircuits.\n\nConsumer  units  in  dwellings  now  have  to  be  manufactured  from \nnon-combustible material, e.g. steel, or be enclosed in a metal enclosure. \nThis is in order to contain \ufb01re.\n\nPolyvinyl chloride\n\nPVC is a thermoplastic polymer widely used in electrical installation work \nfor cable insulation, conduit and trunking. General-purpose PVC is man-\nufactured to BS 6746.\n\nPVC in its raw state is a white powder; it is only after the addition of plas-\nticizers and stabilizers that it acquires the form with which we are familiar.\n\nDegradation\n\nAll PVC polymers are degraded or reduced in quality by heat and light. \nSpecial  stabilizers  added  during  manufacture  help  to  retard  this  degra-\ndation  at  high  temperatures.  However,  it  is  recommended  that  PVC-\nsheathed  cables  or  thermoplastic  \ufb01ttings  for  luminaires  (light  \ufb01ttings) \nshould not be installed where the temperature is likely to rise above 60\u00b0C. \nCables insulated with high-temperature PVC (up to 80\u00b0C) should be used \nfor drops to lampholders and entries into batten holders. PVC conduit and \ntrunking should not be used in temperatures above 60\u00b0C.\n\nEmbrittlement and cracking\n\nPVC  exposed  to  low  temperatures  becomes  brittle  and  will  crack  easily \nif stressed. Although both rigid and \ufb02exible PVC used in cables and con-\nduit can reach as low as \u20135\u00b0C without becoming brittle, the regulations \n\n\f70\n\nProtection\n\n recommend  that  general-purpose  PVC-insulated  cables  should  not  be \ninstalled in areas where the temperature is likely to be consistently below \n0\u00b0C. It is further recommended that PVC-insulated cable should not be \nhandled unless the ambient temperature is above 0\u00b0C and unless the cable \ntemperature has been above 0\u00b0C for at least 24 hours.\n\nWhere  rigid  PVC  conduit  is  to  be  installed  in  areas  where  the  ambient \ntemperature is below \u20135\u00b0C but not lower than \u201325\u00b0C, type B conduit man-\nufactured to BS 4607 should be used.\n\nWhen  PVC-insulated  cables  are  installed  in  loft  spaces  insulated  with \npolystyrene  granules,  contact  between  the  two  polymers  can  cause  the \nplasticizer in the PVC to migrate to the granules. This causes the PVC to \nharden and, although there is no change in the electrical properties, the \ninsulation may crack if disturbed.\n\nProtection against ingress of solid objects and liquids\n\nIn order to protect live parts of equipment being contacted by foreign solid \nbodies  or  liquid,  and  also  to  prevent  persons  or  livestock  from  coming \ninto contact with live or moving parts, such equipment is housed inside \nan enclosure.\n\nThe degree of protection offered by such an enclosure is indicated by an \nindex of protection (IP) code, as shown in Table 5.1.\n\nIt will be seen from Table 5.1 that, for instance, an enclosure to IP 56 is \ndustproof and waterproof.\n\nSo, typical IP codes that would be experienced in the domestic installation \nwould be IPXXB or IP2X and IPXXD or IP4X (IPXXB is protection against \n\ufb01nger contact only and IPXXD protection against penetration by 1 mm \ndiameter wires).\n\nPROTECTION OF PERSONS/LIVESTOCK AGAINST \nDANGERS\n\nProtection against electric shock\n\nThere are two ways of receiving an electric shock, both of which have been \ndiscussed in depth in Chapter 3.\n\n\fProtection\n\n71\n\n  Table 5.1   \n\nIP Codes\n\nFirst numeral: Mechanical protection\n0.   No protection of persons against contact with live or moving parts inside the enclosure. \n\nNo protection of equipment against ingress of solid foreign bodies.\n\n1.   Protection against accidental or inadvertent contact with live or moving parts inside \nthe enclosure by a large surface of the human body (e.g. a hand) but not protection \nagainst deliberate access to such parts. Protection against ingress of large solid foreign \nbodies.\n\n2.   Protection against contact with live or moving parts inside the enclosure by \ufb01ngers.\nProtection against ingress of medium-size solid foreign bodies (12.5 mm spheres).\n3.   Protection against contact with live or moving parts inside the enclosure by tools, wires \nor such objects of thickness greater than 2.5 mm. Protection against ingress of small \nforeign bodies.\n\n4.   Protection against contact with live or moving parts inside the enclosure by tools, wires \nor such objects of thickness greater than 1 mm. Protection against ingress of small \nsolid foreign bodies.\n\n5.   Complete protection against contact with live or moving parts inside the enclosure. \n\nProtection against harmful deposits of dust. The ingress of dust is not totally prevented, \nbut dust cannot enter in an amount suf\ufb01cient to interfere with satisfactory operation of \nthe equipment enclosed.\n\n6.   Complete protection against contact with live or moving parts inside the enclosures. \n\nProtection against ingress of dust.\n\nSecond numeral: Liquid protection\n0.   No protection.\n1.   Protection against drops of condensed water. Drops of condensed water falling on the \n\nenclosure shall have no harmful effect.\n\n2.   Protection against drops of liquid. Drops of falling liquid shall have no harmful effect \n\nwhen the enclosure is tilted at any angle up to 15(cid:36) from the vertical.\n\n3.   Protection against rain. Water falling in rain at an angle equal to or smaller than 60(cid:36) \n\nwith respect to the vertical shall have no harmful effect.\n\n4.   Protection against splashing. Liquid splashed from any direction shall have no harmful \n\neffect.\n\n5.   Protection against water jets. Water projected by a nozzle from any direction under \n\nstated conditions shall have no harmful effect.\n\n6.   Protection against conditions on ships\u2019 decks (deck with watertight equipment). Water \n\nfrom heavy seas shall not enter the enclosures under prescribed conditions.\n\n7.   Protection against immersion in water. It must not be possible for water to enter the \n\nenclosure under stated conditions of pressure and time.\n\n8.   Protection against inde\ufb01nite immersion in water under speci\ufb01ed pressure. It must not \n\nbe possible for water to enter the enclosure.\n\nX    Indicates no speci\ufb01ed protection.\n\n\f72\n\nProtection\n\nProtection against overcurrent\n\nAn overcurrent is a current greater than the rated current of a circuit. It \nmay occur in two ways:\n\n  1.   As an overload current.\n  2.   As a short circuit or fault current.\n\nThese conditions need to be protected against in order to avoid damage to \ncircuit conductors and equipment. In practice, fuses and circuit breakers \nwill ful\ufb01l both of these needs.\n\nOverloads\n\nOverloads  are  overcurrents,  occurring  in  healthy  circuits.  They  may  be \ncaused,  for  example,  by  faulty  appliances  or  by  connecting  too  many \n appliances to a circuit.\n\nShort circuits\n\nA short circuit is the current that will \ufb02ow when a \u2018bridge\u2019 occurs between \nlive  conductors  (line-to-neutral  for  single-phase  and  line-to-line  for \n three-phase). Prospective short-circuit current is the same, but the term is \nusually used to signify the value of short circuit at fuse or circuit-breaker \npositions.\n\nProspective short-circuit current is of great importance. However, before \ndiscussing it or any other overcurrent further, it might be wise to address \nthe subject of fuses, circuit breakers and their characteristics.\n\nFuses and circuit breakers\n\nAs we know, a fuse is the weak link in a circuit, which will break when too \nmuch current \ufb02ows, thus protecting the circuit conductors from damage.\n\nIt  must  be  remembered  that  the  priority  of  a  fuse  or  circuit  breaker  is \nto protect the circuit conductors, not the appliance or the user. Calcula-\ntion of cable size, therefore, automatically involves the correct selection \nof  protective devices.\n\n\fProtection\n\n73\n\nThere are many different types and sizes of fuse, all designed to perform a \ncertain function. The IET Regulations refer to only four of these: BS 3036, \nBS 88-2 E and G, BS 88-3 C and BS 1362 fuses. It is perhaps sensible to \ninclude, at this point, circuit breakers to BS 3871 and BS EN 60898 and \nRCBOs to BS EN 61009.\n\nFuses\n\nA fuse is simply a device which carries a metal element, usually tinned \ncopper,  which  will  melt  and  break  the  circuit  when  excessive  current \n\ufb02ows. The three types of fuse are:\n\n  1.   the rewirable or semi-enclosed fuse\n  2.   the cartridge fuse and fuse link\n  3.   the high-breaking-capacity (HBC) fuse.\n\nThe rewirable fuse (BS 3036)\n\nA  rewirable  fuse  consists  of  a  fuse,  holder,  a  fuse  element  and  a  fuse  \ncarrier (the holder and carrier being made of porcelain or Bakelite). The \ncircuits for which this type of fuse is designed have a colour code, which \nis marked on the fuse holder and is as follows:\n\n45 A \u2013 green\n30 A \u2013 red\n20 A \u2013 yellow\n15 A \u2013 blue\n  5 A \u2013 white\n\nAlthough this type of fuse is very common in older domestic installations, \nas it is cheap and easy to repair, it has serious disadvantages:\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)The  fact  that  it  is  repairable  enables  the  wrong  size  of  fuse  wire \n\n( element) to be used.\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)The elements become weak after long usage and may break under \n\nnormal conditions.\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)Normal starting-current surges (e.g. when motors are switched on) are  \n\u2018seen\u2019 by the fuse as an overload and may, therefore, break the circuit.\n(cid:402)   The fuse holder and carrier can become damaged as a result of arc-\n\ning in the event of a heavy overload or short circuit.\n\n \n\f74\n\nProtection\n\nCartridge fuse (BS 88-3 and BS 1362)\n\nA cartridge fuse consists of a porcelain tube with metal and caps to which \nthe element is attached. The tube is \ufb01lled with silica.\n\nThese  fuses  are  found  generally  in  modem  plug  tops  used  with  13  A \nsocket outlets (BS 1362), in some distribution boards and at mains intake \npositions (BS 1361, now BS 88-3 C). They have the advantage over the \nrewirable fuse of not deteriorating, of accuracy in breaking at rated values \nand of not arcing when interrupting faults. They are, however, expensive \nto replace.\n\nHigh-breaking-capacity fuses\n\nThe  HBC  fuse  is  a  sophisticated  variation  of  the  cartridge  fuse  and  is \nnormally found protecting motor circuits and industrial installations. It \nconsists of a porcelain body \ufb01lled with silica with a silver element and lug \ntype  end  caps.  Another  feature  is  the  indicating  element,  which  shows \nwhen the fuse has blown.\n\nIt  is  very  fast-acting  and  can  discriminate  between  a  starting  surge  and \nan overload.\n\nCircuit breakers (BS EN 60898)\n\nThese protective devices have two elements, one thermal and one elec-\ntro-magnetic.  The  \ufb01rst,  a  bi-metal  strip,  operates  for  overloads  and  the \nsecond, a sensitive solenoid, detects short circuits.\n\nThese devices have the advantage over the fuse in that they may be reset \nafter they have operated (provided the fault current has caused no damage).\n\nClass of protection\n\nIt will be evident that each of the protective devices just discussed pro-\nvides a different level of protection (i.e. rewirable fuses are slower to oper-\nate  and  less  accurate  than  circuit  breakers).  In  order  to  classify  these \ndevices,  it  is  important  to  have  some  means  of  knowing  their  circuit \nbreaking and fusing performance. This is achieved for fuses by the use of \na fusing factor:\n\n\fProtection\n\n75\n\nFusing factor =\n\nFusing current\n\nCurrent rating\n\nwhere  the  fusing  current  is  the  minimum  current  causing  the  fuse  to \noperate and the current rating is the maximum current which the fuse is \ndesigned to carry without operating. For example, a 5 A fuse which oper-\nates only when 9 A \ufb02ows will have a fusing factor of 9/5 = 1.8.\n\nRewirable fuses have a fusing factor of about 1.8 to 2.\nCartridge fuses have a fusing factor of between 1.25 and 1.75.\nHBC fuses have a fusing factor of up to 1.25 (maximum).\nCircuit breakers are designed to operate at no more than 1.45 times \n\ntheir rating.\n\nBreaking capacity of fuses and circuit breakers\n\nWhen a short circuit occurs, the current may, for a fraction of a second, \nreach hundreds or even thousands of amperes. The protective device must \nbe able to break or, in the case of a circuit breaker, make such a current \nwithout damage to its surroundings by arcing, overheating or the scatter-\ning of hot particles.\n\nTable  5.2  indicates  the  breaking  capacity  of  fuses  typically  found  in \ndomestic installations.\n\nThe breaking capacity of a circuit breaker to BS 3871 type 1, 2 or 3 of \nany  rating  is  indicated  by  an  \u2018M\u2019  number  (i.e.  M3-3  kA,  M6-6  kA  and \nM9-9 kA).\n\nFor circuit breakers to BS EN 60898 types B, C and D, of any rating, there \nare  two  values  quoted.  The  \ufb01rst,  Icn,  must  always  exceed  the  value  of \nthe prospective short-circuit current at the point at which it is installed. \n\n  Table 5.2    Breaking Capacities of Fuses Used in Domestic Installations\n\nBritish Standard Number\n\nCurrent Rating\n\nBreaking Capacity\n\nBS 3036 semi-enclosed re-wireable\n\nBS 1362 plug-top cartridge fuse\n\n5\u201360 A\n\n2\u201313 A\n\nup to 4000 A\n\n6000 A\n\nBS 88-3 service fuse and consumer unit fuse\n\n5\u2013100 A\n\n16 500 A\n\n\f76\n\nProtection\n\nThe second, Ics, is the maximum fault current the device can withstand \nwithout damage or loss of performance. Typical values are\n\nIcn \u2013 1.5 kA, 3 kA, 6 kA, 10 kA, 15 kA, 25 kA\nIcs \u2013 1.5 kA, 3 kA, 6 kA, 7.5 kA, 7.5 kA, 10 kA\n\nCircuit breakers to BS 3871 and fuses to BS 1361 are no longer manu- \nfactured, but will, of course, remain in use until they need replacing. Of \nthe BS EN 60898 CB range, it is the type B that will be most common in \ndomestic installations.\n\nRemember, both fuses and circuit breakers must be selected not only for \ntheir ability to carry the design current, but also to break and, in the case \nof circuit breakers, make the prospective short-circuit current at the point \nat which they are installed.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nIn any typical domestic installation there is a main DNO fuse and \ufb01nal \ncircuit protection. In some instances, there is a local plug-top or connec-\ntion unit fuse for socket outlets and water heating, etc. The ratings of these \ndevices should be such that the higher-rated device should not operate in the \nevent of a fault in part of the installation protected by a lower-rated device. \nFor example, a fault on a washing machine should only operate the 13 A BS  \n1362 plug-top fuse, not the circuit protection or the main intake fuse.\n\nPosition of protective devices\n\nWhen there is a reduction in the current-carrying capacity of a conductor, \na  protective  device  is  required.  There  are,  however,  some  exceptions  to \nthis requirement. These are listed clearly in the IET Regulations. As an \nexample, protection is not needed at a ceiling rose, where the cable size \nchanges from the 1.0 mm2 to, say, the 0.5 mm2 for the lampholder \ufb02ex. \nThis is permitted as it is not expected that lamps will cause overloads.\n\nResidual current devices\n\nNo commentary on protective devices would be complete without refer-\nence  to  RCDs.  The  uses  and  applications  of  these  devices  have  already \nbeen indicated in Chapter 2 and Table 3.3.\n\n\fProtection\n\n77\n\nTest push and resistor \n\nL \n\nN \n\nTrip coil \n\nSearch \ncoil \n\nLoad \n\n  FIGURE 5.1 \n\nIron core \n\nPrinciple of operation of an RCD\n\nFigure  5.1  illustrates  the  construction  of  an  RCD.  In  a  healthy  circuit, \nthe same current passes through the line coil and the load, and then back \nthrough the neutral coil. Hence, the magnetic effects of line and neutral \ncurrents cancel out. In a faulty circuit, either line-to-earth or neutral-to-\nearth,  these  currents  are  no  longer  equal.  Therefore,  the  out-of-balance \ncurrent  produces  some  residual  magnetism  in  the  core.  As  this  magne-\ntism  is  alternating,  it  links  with  the  turns  of  the  search  coil,  inducing \nan  electro-motive  force  (EMF)  in  it.  This  EMF  in  turn  drives  a  current \nthrough the trip coil, causing operation of the tripping mechanism.\n\nNuisance tripping\n\nCertain appliances (e.g. cookers, water heaters, etc.) tend to have, by the \nnature of their construction and use, some leakage currents to earth and \nfreezers cause some switching surges. These are quite normal, but could \ncause the operation of an RCD protecting an entire installation.\n\nThis can be overcome by using split-load consumer units, where socket- \noutlet  circuits  are  protected  by  a  30  mA  RCD,  leaving  all  other  circuits \ncontrolled by a normal mains switch, or, as we have seen in Chapter 2 for \nTT systems, the use of a 100 mA RCD for protecting circuits other than \nsocket outlets.\n\nProbably the best method is to use RCBOs. These are combined RCD/CBs \nand can be selected in rating for each individual circuit.\n\n\f\fC H A P T E R   2\nC H A P T E R   6\n\nCircuit Design\n\nImportant terms/topics covered in this chapter:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Design current\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Diversity\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Basic circuit design\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Nominal rating of protective devices\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Rating factors\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Cable selection and voltage drop\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Shock and thermal constraints\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Selection of cpc using tabulated values or the adiabatic equation\n\nBy the end of this chapter the reader should:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) know the sequence of steps in a simple design procedure,\n(cid:402)(cid:3) be able to calculate single phase design currents,\n(cid:402)(cid:3) be able to select suitable protective devices,\n(cid:402)(cid:3) understand the importance and application of rating factors,\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)be able to select appropriate cable sizes for current-carrying capacity \n\nand voltage drop,\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)understand  the  determination  of  shock  risk  and  cable  thermal \n\nconstraints,\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)be able to carry out simple design calculations.\n\nBefore  we  embark  on  the  process  of  calculating  cable  sizes,  it  is  per-\nhaps  best  to  consider  the  common  types  of  accessory  and  appliance \nthat are used in domestic installations. All current-consuming electrical \napparatus is given a rating which indicates the amount of power it will \nconsume.\n\nSome typical loadings of domestic appliances are given in Table 6.1.\n\nConductors  and  the  current-carrying  components  of  accessories  (e.g. \nswitches, fuses, circuit breakers, socket outlets and plugs) must be large \nenough  to  carry  the  maximum  current  which  the  connected  apparatus \ncan cause to \ufb02ow, without overheating or being overstressed.

Therefore, before \nthe required size or \u2018rating\u2019 of a conductor or accessory can be determined, \nthe consumption of the connected apparatus in amperes must be calcu-\nlated. This is known as the design current (Ib) of the circuit and can be \ndetermined from\n\nIb =\n\nPower (watts)\n\nVolts\n\nAs an example, a 1 kW/230 V electric \ufb01re takes 4.35 A when connected \nto a 230 V supply.\n\nDIVERSITY\n\nThe size of a cable or accessory is not necessarily determined by the total \npower  rating  of  all  the  current-consuming  devices  connected  to  it.  It \ndepends on what percentage of the connected load is likely to be operating \nat any one time. This percentage use is called the diversity factor.\n\nTable 6.2 gives an indication of the diversity factors that may be applied to \nparts of an installation, but it must be remembered that the \ufb01gures given \n\n\fCircuit Design\n\n81\n\n  Table 6.2    Allowances for Diversity\n\nCircuit\n\nLighting\n\nCooking appliances\n\nInstantaneous water heaters  \n\n(showers, etc.)\n\nPercentage Diversity\n\n66%\n\nthe \ufb01rst 10 A of the cooker load + 30% of the \nremainder + 5 A if the cooker unit has a \nsocket outlet\n\n100% of full load of the \ufb01rst and second largest \nappliances + 25% of full load of remaining \nappliances\n\nWater heaters thermostatically  \n\nno diversity allowed\n\ncontrolled (immersion  \nheaters)\n\nRing and radial circuits to BS 1363\n\n100% of full load of largest circuit + 40% of full \n\nload of all other circuits\n\nare  only  a  guide.  The  amount  by  which  the  \ufb01gures  given  are  increased \nor decreased for any given installation should be decided by the engineer \nresponsible for the design. The values given in Table 6.2 refer to percent-\nages of connected load. In calculating the maximum current, appliances \nand socket outlets should be considered in order of their current ratings, \nthe largest \ufb01rst.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  object  of  applying  diversity  to  domestic  \n\ufb01nal circuits is not to enable a reduction in circuit cable size, but to arrive \nat a reduced current demand for the whole installation. This will mean \nthat the size of the main tails, consumer unit and any control gear, etc., \ncan be realistically sized.\n\nExample: The maximum demand of an 8 kW/230 V cooker would be\n\n8000/230 = 35 A\n\nThe assumed demand after applying diversity would be\n\n10 + 30% of (35 10) = 10 + 30 \u00d7 25/100 = 17.5 A\n\nThis is less than the current rating of a 1.5 mm2 cable, but it would not \nbe wise to supply the cooker with that size. The cable size should be based \non the cooker\u2019s maximum demand.\n\n\f82\n\nCircuit Design\n\nWhere  \ufb02uorescent  or  other  discharge  lighting  is  involved,  a  factor  of  \n1.8 is used to take into consideration the associated control gear.\n\nFor  example,  an  80  W/230  V  \ufb02uorescent  \ufb01tting  will  have  a  current  \nrating of\n\n80 \u00d7 1.8/230 = 0.63 A\n\nBASIC CIRCUIT DESIGN\n\nHow do we begin to design? Clearly, plunging into calculations of cable \nsize is of little value unless the type of cable and its method of installation \nis known. This, in turn, will depend on the installation\u2019s environment. At \nthe same time, we would need to know whether the supply was single- or \nthree-phase, what the earthing arrangements were and so on. Here then \nis our starting point and it is referred to in Part 3 of the IET Regulations \nas \u2018Assessment of General Characteristics\u2019.\n\nHaving ascertained all the necessary details, we can decide on an instal-\nlation method, the type of cable and how we will protect against electric \nshock and overcurrents. We would now be ready to begin the calculation \npart  of  the  design  procedure.  Basically,  there  are  eight  stages  in  such  a \nprocedure.  These  are  the  same  whatever  the  type  of  installation,  be  it \na  cooker  circuit  or  a  steel  wire  armoured  (SWA)  cable  feeding  a  remote \ngarage.\n\nHere then are the eight basic steps in a simpli\ufb01ed form.\n\n  1.   Determine the design current Ib.\n  2.   Select the rating of the protection In.\n  3.   Select the relevant rating factors (CFs).\n  4.   Divide In by the relevant CFs to give tabulated cable current-carrying \n\ncapacity It.\n\n  5.   Choose a cable size to suit It.\n  6.   Check the voltage drop.\n  7.   Check for shock risk constraints.\n  8.   Check for thermal constraints.\n\nLet us now examine each stage in detail.\n\n\fCircuit Design\n\n83\n\nDesign current\n\nIn  many  instances,  the  design  current  Ib  is  quoted  by  the  manufac-\nturer, but there are times when it has to be calculated. In this case, the  \nfollowing  two  formulae  are  involved  (one  for  single-phase  and  one  for \nthree-phase).\n\nSingle-phase Ib = P/V (V is usually 230 V)\nP\n\nThree-phase Ib = \n\n (VL is usually 400 V)\n\n(cid:51)(cid:17)(cid:3)\u00d7(cid:3)VL\n\nNominal setting of protection In\n\nHaving  determined  Ib,  we  must  now  select  the  nominal  setting  of \nthe   protection  In  such  that  In  (cid:42)  Ib.  This  value  may  be  taken  from  IET \n Regulations or from the manufacturer\u2019s charts. The choice of fuse or cir-\ncuit breaker type is also important and may have to be changed if cable \nsizes or loop impedances are too high.\n\nRating factors\n\nWhen  a  cable  carries  its  full-load  current,  it  can  become  warm.  \nThis is no problem unless its temperature rises further due to other in\ufb02u-\nences,  in  which  case  the  insulation  could  be  damaged  by  overheating. \nThese  other  in\ufb02uences  are  high  ambient  temperature,  cables  grouped \ntogether  closely,  uncleared  overcurrents  and  contact  with  thermal  \ninsulation.  For  each  of  these  conditions,  there  is  a  rating  factor  (CF)  \nwhich  will  respectively  be  called  Ca,  Cg,  Cf  and  Ci,  the  application  of \nwhich will have the effect of correcting cable current-carrying capacity or  \ncable size.\n\nAmbient temperature Ca\n\nThe cable ratings quoted in the IET Regulations are based on an ambient \ntemperature  of  30\u00b0C,  and  so  it  is  only  above  this  temperature  that  an \nadverse correction is needed. The regulations give factors for all types of \nprotection.\n\n\f84\n\nCircuit Design\n\nGrouping Cg\n\nWhen cables are grouped together, they impart heat to each other. There-\nfore,  the  more  cables  there  are  the  more  heat  they  will  generate,  thus \nincreasing the temperature of each cable. The IET Regulations give factors \nfor such groups of cables or circuits. It should be noted that the \ufb01gures \ngiven are for cables equally loaded and so correction may not necessarily \nbe needed for cables grouped at the outlet of a domestic consumer unit, \nfor example, where there is a mixture of different loads.\n\nProtection by BS 3036 fuse and circuit conditions Cf\n\nAs  we  have  already  discussed  in  Chapter  5,  BS  3036  fuses  have  a  high \nfusing  factor  and,  as  a  result,  a  factor  of  0.725  must  always  be  applied \nwhen BS 3036 fuses are used together with any factor for the installation \nconditions such as routing a cable underground.\n\nThermal insulation Ci\n\nWith the modern trend towards energy saving and the installation of ther-\nmal insulation, there may be a need to derate cables to account for heat \nretention. The values of cable current-carrying capacity given in the IET \nRegulations  have  been  adjusted  for  situations  when  thermal  insulation \ntouches one side of a cable.\n\nHowever, if a cable is totally surrounded by thermal insulation for more \nthan 0.5 m, a factor of 0.5 must be applied to the tabulated clipped direct \nratings. For less than 0.5 m, derating factors shown in Table 6.3 should \nbe applied.\n\n  Table 6.3    Thermal Insulation Factors\n\nLength of Cable (m) in  \nThermal Insulation\n\nDerating Factor\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\n400\n\n0.88\n\n0.78\n\n0.63\n\n0.51\n\n\fCircuit Design\n\n85\n\nApplication of rating factors\n\nSome or all of the onerous conditions just outlined may affect a cable along \nits whole length or parts of it at the same time. So, consider the following:\n\n  1.   If a cable ran for the whole of its length, grouped with others of the \nsame size in a high ambient temperature, and was totally surrounded \nwith thermal insulation, it would seem logical to apply all the CFs, \nas they all affect the whole cable run. Certainly, the factors for the BS \n3036 fuse, grouping and thermal insulation should be used. However, \nit is doubtful if the ambient temperature will have any effect on the \ncable,  as  the  thermal  insulation,  if  it  is  ef\ufb01cient,  will  prevent  heat \nreaching the cable. Hence, apply Ca, Cg and Cf.\n\n  2.   If, however, the cable \ufb01rst runs grouped, then leaves the group and \nruns in high ambient temperature and \ufb01nally is enclosed in thermal \ninsulation, there will be three different conditions, each affecting the \ncable in different areas. The BS 3036 fuse affects the whole cable run \nand, therefore, Cf must be used, but there is no need to apply all of \nthe remaining factors as the worst one will automatically compen-\nsate for the others.\n\nHaving chosen the relevant rating factors, we now apply them as divisors \nto the rating of the protective device In in order to calculate the tabulated \ncurrent-carrying capacity It of the cable to be used.\n\nTabulated current-carrying capacity It\n\nIt =\n\nIn\nRelevant CFs\n\n  Note \n\nIn may be replaced by the design current Ib, if the circuit is not likely to be overloaded.\n\nCable selection\n\nHaving  established  the  tabulated  current-carrying  capacity  of  the  cable \nrequired,  the  actual  size  is  found  from  a  relevant  table  in  the  IET \nRegulations.\n\n\f86\n\nCircuit Design\n\nVoltage drop\n\nThe resistance of a conductor increases as the length increases and/or the \ncross-sectional area decreases. Associated with an increased resistance is \na drop in voltage, which means that a load at the end of a long, thin cable \nwill not have the full supply voltage available.\n\nThe  IET  Regulations  require  that  the  voltage  drop  V  should  not  be  \nso  excessive  that  equipment  does  not  function  safely.  They  fur-\nther  indicate  that  a  drop  of  no  more  than  3%  of  the  nominal  voltage  \nfor a lighting circuit and 5% for a power circuit will satisfy. This means \nthat:\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)for  single-phase  230  V,  the  voltage  drop  for  lighting  should  not \nexceed 3% of 230 V = 6.9 V and for power should not exceed 5% of \n230 V = 11.5 V\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)for three-phase 400 V, the voltage drops should not exceed 12 and  \n\n20 V respectively.\n\nFor example, the voltage drop on a power circuit supplied from a 230 V \nsource by a 16.0 mm2 two-core copper cable 23 m long, clipped direct and \ncarrying a design current of 33 A will be:\n\nCable volt drop Vd = \n\n(mV)\n\n(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:14)\n\n \u00d7 lb \u00d7 length(l) (mv from IET Regs.)\n\n2.8 \u00d7 33 \u00d7 23\n\n= \n\n = 2.125 V\n\n(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:14)\n\nAs we have just seen, the maximum volt drop for a 230 V power circuit is \n11.5 V, so we can determine the maximum length of the cable by trans-\nposing this formula\n\nMax length = \n\nVd \u00d7 1000\n\nmV \u00d7 Ib\n\n11.5 \u00d7 (cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:14)\n\n= \n\n = 124 m\n\n(cid:16)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:3)\u00d7 33\n\nThere  are  other  constraints,  however,  that  may  not  permit  such  a  \nlength.\n\n\fCircuit Design\n\n87\n\nShock risk\n\nThis topic has already been discussed in full in Chapter 3. To recap, how-\never, the actual loop impedance Zs should not exceed those values given \nin the IET Regulations.\n\nThis ensures that circuits feeding \ufb01nal circuits up to 32 A will be discon-\nnected, in the event of an earth fault, in less than 0.4 s, and that distribu-\ntion circuits will be disconnected in less than 5 s.\n\nRemember,\n\nZs = Ze + (R1 + R2)\n\nThermal constraints\n\nThe IET Regulations require that we either select or check the size of a \ncircuit protective conductor (cpc) against tabulated values, or calculate its \nsize using an equation.\n\nSelection of cpc using tabulated values\n\nThese simply tell us that\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)for line conductors up to and including 16.0 mm2, the cpc should be \n\nat least the same size\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)for line conductors over 16.0 and up to 35.0 mm2, the cpc should be \n\nat least 16 mm2\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)for line conductors over 35.0 mm2, the cpc should be at least half \n\nthis size.\n\nThis is all very well, but for large sizes of line conductor the cpc is also \nlarge and hence costly to supply and install. Also, composite cables, such \nas the typical twin with cpc 6242 Y type, have cpcs smaller than the line \nconductor and consequently do not comply with the statements just made.\n\nCalculation of cpc using the adiabatic equation\n\nThe adiabatic equation is\n\nS =  (cid:51)I2(cid:3)\u00d7 t\n\nk\n\n\f88\n\nCircuit Design\n\nwhere:\n\nS = minimum CSA of cpc\nI = fault current\nt = disconnection time of protection\nk =  a  factor  (from  the  IET  Regulations)  dependent  on  the  conductor \n\n material and insulation.\n\nThis enables us to check on a selected size of cable or on an actual size in \na multicore cable. In order to apply the equation, we need \ufb01rst to calculate \nthe earth fault current from\n\nI = \n\nU0\nZs\n\nwhere U0 is the nominal voltage to earth (usually 230 V) and Zs is the \nactual earth fault loop impedance.\n\nNext, we select a k factor from the IET Regulations and then determine \nthe  disconnection  time  t  from  the  relevant  curve  (once  again  in  the \nRegulations).\n\nWhen we apply these \ufb01gures to the equation, the value we obtain for \u2018S\u2019 \nmust be less than the size we have chosen or is incorporated in the cable.\n\nAn example of circuit design\n\nA consumer lives in a bungalow with a detached garage and workshop, as \nshown in Figure 6.1. The building method is traditional brick and timber.\n\nThe  mains  intake  position  is  at  high  level  and  comprises  an  80  A  BS  \n88-3 230 V main fuse, an 80 A rated meter and a six-way 80 A consumer \nunit housing BS EN 60898 type B circuit breakers as follows:\n\nRing circuit \nLighting circuit \nImmersion heater circuit \nCooker circuit\nShower circuit\nSpare way\n\n32 A\n  6 A\n16 A\n32 A\n32 A\n\n\fCircuit Design\n\n89\n\n8.6 kW, 230 V \n\nWorkshop \n\n3  m \n\n2.5m \n\nGarage \n\n5  m \n\n7m \n\n1 m \n\nE \n<0 \n\nBungalow \n\nSuggested \ncable route \n\n  FIGURE 6.1 \n\nThe  cooker  is  rated  at  30  A,  with  no  socket  in  the  cooker  unit.  The  \nmain tails are 16.0 mm2 double-insulated PVC, with a 6.0 mm2 earth- \ning  conductor.  There  is  no  main  protective  equipotential  bonding.  \nThe  earthing  system  is  TN-S,  with  an  external  loop  impedance  Ze  of  \n0.3 (cid:49). The prospective short-circuit current (PSCC) at the origin has been \nmeasured as 800 A. The roof space is insulated to full depth of the ceiling \njoists  and  the  temperature  in  the  roof  space  is  not  expected  to  exceed \n35\u00b0C.\n\nThe  consumer  wishes  to  convert  the  workshop  into  a  pottery  room  \nand  install  an  8.6  kW/230  V  electric  kiln.  The  design  procedure  is  as \nfollows.\n\n\f90\n\nCircuit Design\n\nAssessment of general characteristics\n\nThe present maximum demand, applying diversity, is\n\nRing\n\nLighting (66% of 6 A)\n\nImmersion heater\n\nCooker (10 A + 30% of 20 A)\n\nShower\n\nTotal\n\n32 A\n\n3.96 A\n\n16 A\n\n16 A\n\n32 A\n\n100 A\n\nReference  to  the  current  rating  tables  in  the  IET  Regulations  will  show \nthat  the  existing  main  tails  are  too  small  and  should  be  uprated.  So, \nthe addition of another 8.6 kW of load is not possible with the present \narrangement.\n\nThe current taken by the kiln is 8600/230 = 37.4 A. Therefore, the new \nmaximum demand is 100 + 37.4 = 137.4 A.\n\nSupply details are single-phase 230 V, 50 Hz. Earthing: TN-S, Ze: 0.3 (cid:49), \nPSCC at origin (measured): 800 A. Decisions must now be made as to the \ntype of cable, the installation method and the type of protective device. As \nthe existing arrangement is not satisfactory, the supply authority must be \ninformed of the new maximum demand, as a larger main fuse and service \ncable may be required.\n\nSizing the main tails\n\n  1.

It should have a resolution (i.e. a detectable difference \nin resistance) of at least 0.05 m(cid:49).\n\nAn insulation resistance tester\n\nAn insulation resistance tester must be capable of delivering 1 mA when \nthe required test voltage is applied across the minimum acceptable value \nof insulation resistance.\n\nConsequently,  an  instrument  selected  for  use  on  a  low-voltage  system \nshould be capable of delivering 1 mA at 500 V across a resistance of 1 mW.\n\nA loop impedance tester\n\nThis instrument functions by creating, in effect, an earth fault for a brief \nmoment,  and  is  connected  to  the  circuit  via  a  plug  or  by  \u2018\ufb02ying  leads\u2019 \n connected separately to line, neutral and earth.\n\nThe instrument should only allow an earth fault to exist for a maximum \nof 40 ms and a resolution of 0.01 W is adequate for circuits up to 50 A. \n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n97\n\nAbove this circuit rating, the ohmic values become too small to give such \nan accuracy using a standard instrument and more specialized equipment \nmay be required.\n\nAn RCD tester\n\nUsually connected by the use of a plug, although \ufb02ying leads are needed \nfor  non-socket-outlet  circuits,  this  instrument  allows  a  range  of  out-of-\nbalance currents to \ufb02ow through the RCD to cause its operation within \nspeci\ufb01ed time limits.\n\nThe  test  instrument  should  not  be  operated  for  longer  than  2  s  and  it \nshould have a 10% accuracy across the full range of test currents.\n\nA PFC tester\n\nNormally one half of a dual, loop impedance/PSCC tester, this instrument \nmeasures  the  prospective  line-neutral  or  line-earth  fault  current  at  the \npoint of measurement using the \ufb02ying lead.\n\nAn approved test lamp or voltage indicator\n\nA  \ufb02exible  cord  with  a  lamp  attached  is  not  an  approved  device,  nor  for \nthat  matter  is  the  ubiquitous  \u2018testascope\u2019  or  \u2018neon  screw-driver\u2019,  which \nencourages the passage of current, at low voltage, through the body!\n\nA typical approved test lamp is shown in Figure 7.1.\n\nThe Health and Safety Executive, Guidance Note 38, recommends that \nthe leads and probes associated with test lamps, voltage indicators, volt-\nmeters, etc., have the following characteristics:\n\n  1.   The leads should be adequately insulated and, ideally, fused.\n  2.   The leads, where separate, should be easily distinguished from each \n\nother by colour.\n\n  3.   The leads should be \ufb02exible and suf\ufb01ciently long for their purpose.\n  4.   The probes should incorporate \ufb01nger barriers to prevent accidental \n\ncontact with live parts.\n\n\f98\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nLamp \n\nInsulated lead \n\nMaximum \ntest \nvoltage \nmarked \n\nFused test \nprobes \n\nFinger guards \n\nInsulation \n\n2 mm exposed \nor spring-loaded \nenclosed ti ps \n\n  FIGURE 7.1    Approved test lamp.\n\n  5.   The probes should be insulated and have a maximum of 2 mm of \nexposed metal, but preferably have spring-loaded enclosed tips.\n\nA proving unit\n\nThis is an optional item of test equipment, in that test lamps should be \nproved on a known supply which could, of course, be an adjacent socket \nor lighting point. However, to prove a test lamp on such a known supply \nmay involve entry into enclosures with the associated hazards that could \nbring. A proving unit is a compact device, not much larger than a pack \nof cards, which is capable of electronically developing 230 V d.c. across \nwhich the test lamp may be proved. The exception to this are test lamps \nincorporating 230 V lamps which will not activate from the small power \nsource of the proving unit.\n\nTest lamps must be proved against a voltage similar to that to be tested. \nSo, proving test lamps that incorporate an internal check (i.e. shorting out \nthe probes to make a buzzer sound) is not acceptable if the voltage to be \ntested is higher than that delivered by the test lamp.\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n99\n\nCare of test instruments\n\nThe 1989 Electricity at Work Regulations require that all electrical sys-\ntems  (including  test  instruments)  be  maintained  to  prevent  danger. \nThis does not restrict such maintenance to just a yearly calibration, but \nrequires equipment to be kept in good condition and regularly checked for \naccuracy against known values (e.g. a checkbox). In this way they will be \nsafe to use at all times.\n\nWhilst test instruments and associated leads, probes and clips used in the \nelectrical contracting industry are robust in design and manufacture, they \nstill need to be treated with care and protected from mechanical damage.\n\nTest  gear  should  be  kept  in  a  separate  box  or  case  away  from  tools  and \nsharp objects and the general condition of a tester and leads should always \nbe checked before they are used.\n\nInitial inspection\n\nBefore any testing is carried out, a detailed physical inspection must be \nmade to ensure that all equipment is:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)to a relevant British or Harmonized European Standard\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)erected/installed in compliance with the IET Regulations\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)not damaged in such a way that it could cause danger.\n\nIn order to comply with these requirements, the Regulations give a check-\nlist of items that, where relevant, should be inspected.\n\nHowever,  before  such  an  inspection,  and  test  for  that  matter,  is  carried \nout, certain information must be available to the veri\ufb01er.\n\nThis  information  is  the  result  of  the  \u2018Assessment  of  General  Charac- \nteristics\u2019 required by IET Regulations (Part 3, sections 311, 312 and 313), \ntogether  with  drawings,  charts  and  similar  information  relating  to  the \ninstallation.  For  domestic  installations,  these  diagrams  and  charts  are \nusually in the form of a simple schedule.\n\nInterestingly,  one  of  the  items  on  the  checklist  is  the  presence  of  dia-\ngrams, instructions and similar information. If these are missing, there is \na deviation from the Regulations.\n\n\f100\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nAnother  item  on  the  list  is  the  veri\ufb01cation  of  conductors  for  current- \ncarrying  capacity  and  voltage  drop  in  accordance  with  the  design.  How \ncould this be veri\ufb01ed without all the information? A 32 A type B circuit \nbreaker protecting a length of 4.0 mm2 conductor may look reasonable, \nbut is it correct and, unless you are sure, are you prepared to sign to say \nthat it is?\n\nLet us look then at the general content of the checklist:\n\n  1.   Connection of conductors: Are terminations electrically and mechan-\nically  sound?  Is  insulation  and  sheathing  removed  only  to  a  mini-\nmum to allow satisfactory termination?\n\n  2.   Identi\ufb01cation of conductors: Are conductors correctly identi\ufb01ed in \n\naccordance with the regulations?\n\n  3.   Routing  of  cables:  Are  cables  installed  such  that  account  is  \ntaken of external in\ufb02uences, such as mechanical damage, corrosion \nand heat?\n\n  4.   Conductor  selection:  Are  conductors  selected  for  current-carrying \n\ncapacity and voltage drop in accordance with the design?\n\n  5.   Connection  of  single  pole  devices:  Are  single  pole  protective  and \n\nswitching devices connected in the line conductor only?\n\n  6.   Accessories and equipment: Are all accessories and items of equip-\n\nment correctly connected?\n\n  7.   Thermal effects: Are \ufb01re barriers present where required and protec-\n\ntion against thermal effects provided?\n\n  8.   Protection against shock: What methods have been used to provide \n\nprotection against electric shock?\n\n  9.   Mutual detrimental in\ufb02uence: Are wiring systems installed so that \nthey  can  have  no  harmful  effect  on  non-electrical  systems  or  so \nthat  systems  of  different  currents  or  voltages  are  segregated  where \nnecessary?\n\n  10.   Isolation  and  switching:  Are  the  appropriate  devices  for  isolation \n\nand switching correctly located and installed?\n\n  11.   Undervoltage:  Where  undervoltage  may  give  rise  for  concern,  are \n\nthere protective devices present? \n\n  12.   Protective  devices:  Are  protective  and  monitoring  devices \n correctly chosen and set to ensure automatic disconnection and/or \novercurrent?\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n101\n\n  13.   Labelling: Are all protective devices, switches (where necessary) and \n\nterminals correctly labelled?\n\n  14.   External  in\ufb02uences:  Have  all  items  of  equipment  and  protective \nmeasures been selected in accordance with the appropriate external \nin\ufb02uences?\n\n  15.   Access: Are all means of access to switchgear and equipment adequate?\n  16.   Notices and signs: Are danger notices and warning signs present?\n  17.   Diagrams:  Are  diagrams,  instructions  and  similar  information \n\nrelating to the installation available?\n\n  18.   Erection methods: Have all wiring systems, accessories and equip-\nment  been  selected  and  installed  in  accordance  with  the  require-\nments  of  the  Regulations?  Are  \ufb01xings  for  equipment  adequate  for \nthe environment?\n\nOnce all the relevant items have been inspected, providing there are no \ndefects that may lead to a dangerous situation when testing, the actual \ntesting procedure can start.\n\nTESTING\n\nAlthough BS 7671 only requires the \u2018dead\u2019 tests on an installation to be \nconducted in a particular sequence, it is sensible to add the live tests in \nthe sequence as follows:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Continuity of protective conductors\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Continuity of ring \ufb01nal circuit conductors\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Insulation resistance \n(cid:402)(cid:3) Polarity\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Earth electrode resistance\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)Earth fault loop impedance, total (Zs) and external (Ze)\n(cid:402)(cid:3) RCD\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Prospective fault current\n(cid:402)(cid:3) Functional \n\nContinuity of protective conductors\n\nAll  protective  conductors,  including  main  and  supplementary  bonding \nconductors, must be tested for continuity using a low-reading ohmmeter.\n\n\f102\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nFor main equipotential bonding, there is no single \ufb01xed value of resistance \nabove which the conductor would be deemed unsuitable. Each measured \nvalue,  if  indeed  it  is  measurable  for  very  short  lengths,  should  be  com-\npared with the relevant value for a particular conductor length and size. \nSuch values are shown in Table 7.1.\n\nWhere  a  supplementary  protective  bonding  conductor  has  been \ninstalled between simultaneously accessible exposed and extraneous con-\nductive parts the resistance of the conductor R must be equal to or less \nthan 50/Ia.\n\nSo, R (cid:42) 50/Ia, where 50 is the voltage, above which exposed metal work \nshould not rise and Ia is the minimum current, causing operation of the \ncircuit protective device within 5 s.\n\nFor  example,  suppose  a  45  A  BS  3036  fuse  protects  a  cooker  circuit, \nthe  disconnection  time  for  the  circuit  cannot  be  met,  and  so  a  supple-\nmentary  bonding  conductor  has  been  installed  between  the  cooker  case  \nand  the  adjacent  metal  sink.  The  resistance  R  of  that  conductor  \nshould  not  be  greater  than  50/Ia,  which  in  this  case  is  145  A  (IET \n Regulations). So\n\n50/145 = 0.34 (cid:49)\n\n  Table 7.1    Resistance ((cid:49)) of Copper Conductors at 20\u00b0C\n\nCSA \n(mm)\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n6\n\n10\n\n16\n\n25\n\n35\n\nLength (m)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n0.09\n\n0.18\n\n0.27\n\n0.36\n\n0.45\n\n0.54\n\n0.63\n\n0.72\n\n0.82\n\n0.06\n\n0.12\n\n0.18\n\n0.24\n\n0.3\n\n0.36\n\n0.43\n\n0.48\n\n0.55\n\n50\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n0.04\n\n0.07\n\n0.11\n\n0.15\n\n0.19\n\n0.22\n\n0.26\n\n0.03\n\n0.33\n\n0.37\n\n0.023 0.05\n\n0.07\n\n0.09\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.18\n\n0.21\n\n0.23\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.09\n\n0.11\n\n0.13\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.063 0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.09\n\n0.006 0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.023 0.03\n\n0.034 0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.004 0.007 0.01\n\n0.015 0.02\n\n0.022 0.026 0.03\n\n0.033 0.04\n\n0.003 0.005 0.008 0.01\n\n0.013 0.016 0.019 0.02\n\n0.024 0.03\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n103\n\nHow  then  do  we  conduct  a  test  to  establish  continuity  of  main  or  \nsupplementary bonding conductors? Quite simple really: just connect the \nleads  from  the  continuity  tester  to  the  ends  of  the  bonding  conductor \n(Figure  7.2).  One  end  should  be  disconnected  from  its  bonding  clamp, \notherwise any measurement may include the resistance of parallel paths \nof other earthed metalwork. Remember to zero the instrument \ufb01rst or, if \nthis facility is not available, record the resistance of the test leads so that \nthis value can be subtracted from the test reading.\n\nImportant Note \n\nIf the installation is in operation, never disconnect main bonding conductors unless the \nsupply can be isolated. Without isolation, persons and livestock are at risk of electric \nshock.\n\nThe continuity of circuit protective conductors (cpcs) may be established \nin the same way, but a second method is preferable, as the results of this \nsecond test indicate the value of (R1 + R2) for the circuit in question.\n\nDisconnect only if \nsupply is isolated \n\nGas \n\nEarth clamp \nwith  label \n\nMain protective \n\nbonding conductor \n\n  FIGURE 7.2    Continuity of main protective bonding conductors.\n\nZero/null instrument or \nsubtract test lead resistance \n\nWater \n\n \n\f104\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nL \n\nTemporary \nlink \ncpc \n\nE \n\n  FIGURE 7.3    Continuity of cpc.\n\nReading at last outlet gives \n(R,  + R2 )  value tor the circuit \n\nThe test is conducted in the following way (Figure 7.3):\n\n  1.   Temporarily  link  together  the  line  conductor  and  cpc  of  the  circuit \n\nconcerned in the distribution board or consumer unit.\n\n  2.   Test  between  line  and  cpc  at  each  outlet  in  the  circuit.  A  reading \n\nindicates continuity.\n\n  3.   Record the test result obtained at the furthest point in the circuit. \n\nThis value is (R1 + R2) for the circuit.\n\nThere may be some dif\ufb01culty in determining the (R1 + R2) values of cir-\ncuits  in  installations  that  comprise  steel  conduit  and  trunking  and/or \nSWA and MIMS cables because of the parallel earth paths that are likely \nto exist. In these cases, continuity tests may have to be carried out at the \ninstallation stage before accessories are connected or terminations made \noff as well as after completion.\n\nContinuity of ring \ufb01nal circuit conductors\n\nThe two main reasons for conducting this test are:\n\n  1.   to establish that interconnections in the ring do not exist\n  2.   to  ensure  that  the  cpc  is  continuous  and  to  indicate  the  value  of  \n\n(R1 + R2) for the ring. \n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n105\n\nWhat  then  are  interconnections  in  a  ring  circuit  and  why  is  it  import-\nant  to  locate  them?  Figure  7.4  shows  a  ring  \ufb01nal  circuit  with  an \ninterconnection.\n\nThe  most  likely  cause  of  this  situation  is  where  a  DIY  enthusi-\nast  has  added  sockets  P,  Q,  R  and  S  to  an  existing  ring  A,  B,  C,  D,  E  \nand F.\n\nIn itself, there is nothing wrong with this. The problem arises if a break \noccurs at, say, point Y, or if the terminations fail in socket C or P. Then \nthere would be four sockets all fed from the point X, which would then \nbecome a spur.\n\nSo, how do we identify such a situation with or without breaks at point \nY? A simple resistance test between the ends of the line, neutral or cpcs \nwill only indicate that a circuit exists, whether there are interconnections \nor not. The following test method is based on the idea that the resistance \nmeasured across any diameter of a perfect circle of conductor will always \nbe the same value (Figure 7.5).\n\nThe  perfect  circle  of  conductor  is  achieved  by  cross-connecting  the  line \nand neutral legs of the ring (Figure 7.6).\n\nThe test procedure is as follows:\n\n  1.   Identify the opposite legs of the ring. This is quite easy with sheathed \ncables,  but  with  singles,  each  conductor  will  have  to  be  identi\ufb01ed, \n\nA \n\nB \n\nc \n\np \n\nQ \n\nInterconnection \n\ny \n\nx \n\nF \n\nE \n\nD \n\nS \n\nR \n\nSpur \n\n  FIGURE 7.4    Ring \ufb01nal circuit with interconnection.\n\n\f106\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nCircle of \nconductor \n\nOhms \n\nSame value whatever \ndiameter is measured \n\nL1 \n\nN2 \n\n  FIGURE 7.5 \n\nUne \nloop \n\nOhms \n\nNeutral \nloop \n\n  FIGURE 7.6    Circle formed by cross connection.\n\nL2 \n\nN1 \n\nprobably by taking resistance measurements between each one and \nthe closest socket outlet. This will give three high readings and three \nlow readings, thus establishing the opposite legs.\n\n  2.   Take a resistance measurement between the ends of each conductor \n\nloop. Record this value.\n\n  3.   Cross-connect \n\nthe  ends  of \n\nthe \n\nline  and  neutral \n\nloops  \n\n(Figure 7.7).\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n107\n\nL1 \n\nN1 \n\nL2 \n\nN2 \n\n  FIGURE 7.7    L and N cross connection.\n\n  4.   Measure between line and neutral at each socket on the ring. For \na  perfect  ring,  the  readings  obtained  should  be  substantially  the \nsame.  If  an  interconnection  existed  such  as  shown  in  Figure  7.4 \nthen  sockets  A  to  F  would  all  have  similar  readings,  and  those \nbeyond the interconnection would have gradually increasing values \nto approximately the mid-point of the ring, then decreasing values \nback towards the interconnection. If a break had occurred at point Y \nthe readings from socket S would increase to a maximum at socket \nP. One or two high readings are likely to indicate either loose con-\nnections or spurs. A null reading, i.e. an open circuit indication, is \nprobably  a  reverse  polarity,  either  line-cpc  or  neutral-cpc  reversal. \nThese faults would clearly be recti\ufb01ed and the test at the suspect \nsocket(s) repeated.\n\n  5.   Repeat the above procedure, but in this case cross-connect the line \n\nand cpc loops (Figure 7.8).\n\nIn this instance, if the cable is of the \ufb02at twin type, the readings at each \nsocket will very slightly increase and then decrease around the ring. This \ndifference, due to the line and cpc being different sizes, will not be signi\ufb01-\ncant enough to cause any concern. The measured value is very important; \nit is R1 + R2 for the ring.\n\nAs before, loose connections, spurs and, in this case, L\u2013N cross polarity \nwill be picked up.\n\nTable 7.2 gives the typical approximate ohmic values for a healthy 70 m \nring \ufb01nal circuit wired in 2.5/1.5 \ufb02at twin and cpc cable.\n\n\f108\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nL 1cpc N1 \n\nL2cpcN2 \n\n  FIGURE 7.8    L and cpc cross connection.\n\n  Table 7.2 \n\nInitial measurements\n\nReading at each socket\n\nFor spurs, each metre in length will add the \nfollowing resistance to the above values\n\nInsulation resistance\n\nL1 to L2  N1 to N2  cpc 1 to cpc 2\n\n0.52 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.52 \n\n0.26 \n\n0.85\n\n0.30\u20130.34\n\n0.015 \n\n0.015 \n\n0.02\n\nThis test is probably the most used and yet abused of them all. Affection-\nately known as \u2018meggering\u2019, an insulation resistance test is carried out to \nensure that the insulation of conductors, accessories and equipment is in \na healthy condition and will prevent dangerous leakage currents between \nlive conductors and between live conductors and earth. It also indicates \nwhether any short circuits exist.\n\nInsulation  resistance,  as  discussed,  is  the  resistance  measured  between \nconductors and is made up of countless millions of resistances in parallel \n(Figure 7.9).\n\nThe  more  resistances  there  are  in  parallel,  the  lower  the  overall  resis-\ntance,  and,  in  consequence,  the  longer  a  cable  the  lower  the  insulation \nresistance. Add to this the fact that almost all installation circuits are also \nwired in parallel, and it becomes apparent that tests on large installations \nmay give, if measured as a whole, pessimistically low values, even if there \nare no faults.\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n109\n\nConductors \n\nSheathing \n\nResistance of \ninstallation \n\n  FIGURE 7.9    Cable insulation resistance.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is usual to break down such large instal-\nlations  into  smaller  sections,  \ufb02oor  by  \ufb02oor,  distribution  circuit  by  dis-\ntribution  circuit,  etc.  This  also  helps,  in  the  case  of  periodic  testing,  to \nminimize disruption. The test procedure then is as follows:\n\n  1.   Disconnect all items of equipment such as capacitors and indicator \nlamps, as these are likely to give misleading results. Remove any items \nof equipment likely to be damaged by the test (e.g. dimmer switches \nand electronic timers). Remove all lamps and accessories and discon-\nnect  \ufb02uorescent  and  discharge  \ufb01ttings.  Ensure  that  the  installation \nis  disconnected  from  the  supply,  all  fuses  are  in  place  and  circuit \n breakers  and  switches  are  in  the  on  position.  In  some  instances,  it \nmay  be  impracticable  to  remove  lamps,  etc.,  in  that  case,  the  local \nswitch controlling such equipment may be left in the off position.\n\n\f110\n\nInspection and Testing\n\n  2.   Join together all live conductors of the supply and test between this \njoin and earth. Alternatively, test between each live conductor and \nearth in turn.\n\n  3.   Test between line and neutral. For three-phase systems, join together \nall line conductors and test between this join and neutral. Then test \nbetween  each  of  the  lines.  Alternatively,  test  between  each  of  the \nlive conductors in turn. Installations incorporating two-way lighting \nsystems should be tested twice with the two-way switches in alter-\nnate positions.\n\nTable 7.3 gives the test voltages and minimum values of insulation resis-\ntance for ELV and LV systems.\n\n  Table 7.3 \n\nSystem\n\nSELV and PELV\n\nLV up to 500 V\n\nOver 500 V\n\nTest Voltage\n\nMinimum Insulation Resistance\n\n250 V d.c.\n\n500 V d.c.\n\n1000 V d.c.\n\n0.5 M(cid:49)\n\n1.0 M(cid:49)\n\n1.0 M(cid:49)\n\nIf a value of less than 2 MW is recorded, it may indicate a situation where \na fault is developing, but as yet still complies with the minimum permis-\nsible value. In this case, each circuit should be tested separately to identify \nany faulty circuits.\n\nPolarity\n\nThis simple test, often overlooked, is just as important as all the others \nand many serious injuries and electrocutions could have been prevented if \nonly polarity checks had been carried out.\n\nThe requirements are that:\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)all fuses and single pole switches are in the line conductor\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)the centre contact of an Edison screw type lampholder is connected \nto  the  line  conductor  with  the  exception  of  the  new  E14  and  E27 \nholders which have an insulating material as a screwed part\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)all socket outlets and similar accessories are wired correctly.\n\n(cid:3)\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n111\n\nDistribution board \n\nUne \n\nTemporary \nlink \n\nSwitch wire \n\nSwitch \nwire \n\nN \n\ncpc \n\n  FIGURE 7.10    Lighting polarity.\n\nCpc continuity \n\nmO \n\nPolarity \n\nmO \n\nAlthough polarity is towards the end of the recommended test sequence, \nit would seem sensible, on lighting circuits, for example, to conduct this \ntest at the same time as that for continuity of cpcs (Figure 7.10).\n\nAs  discussed,  polarity  on  ring  \ufb01nal  circuit  conductors  is  achieved  sim-\nply  by  conducting  the  ring  circuit  test.  For  radial  socket  outlet  circuits, \nhowever, this is a little more dif\ufb01cult. The continuity of the cpc will have \nalready been proved by linking line and cpc and measuring between the \nsame terminals at each socket. Whilst a line\u2013cpc reversal would not have \nshown, a line\u2013neutral reversal would have, as there would have been no \nreading at the socket in question. This would have been remedied, and \nso only line\u2013cpc reversals need to be checked. This can be done by link-\ning together line and neutral at the origin and testing between the same \nterminals at each socket. A line\u2013cpc reversal will result in no reading at \nthe socket.\n\nEarth electrode resistance\n\nAs we know, in many rural areas, the supply system is TT and so reliance \nis placed on the general mass of earth for a return path under earth fault \nconditions and connection to earth is made by an electrode, usually of the \nrod type.\n\nIn order to determine the resistance of the earth return path, it is neces-\nsary to measure the resistance that the electrode has with earth.\n\n\f112\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nAn earth fault loop impedance test is carried out between the incoming \nline terminal and the electrode (a standard test for Ze).\n\nThe value obtained is added to the cpc resistance of the protected circuits \nand  this  value  is  multiplied  by  the  operating  current  of  the  RCD.  The \nresulting value should not exceed 50 V.\n\nEarth fault loop impedance\n\nAs  we  have  already  seen  in  Chapter  3,  overcurrent  protective  devices \nmust, under earth fault conditions, disconnect fast enough to reduce the \nrisk of electric shock. This is achieved if the actual value of the earth fault \nloop impedance does not exceed the tabulated maximum values given in \nthe IET Regulations.\n\nThe purpose of the test, therefore, is to determine the actual value of the \nloop  impedance  Zs,  for  comparison  with  those  maximum  values.  It  is \nconducted as follows:\n\n  1.   Ensure that all main protective bonding is in place.\n  2.   Connect  the  test  instrument  either  by  its  BS  1363  plug  or  the  \n\ufb02ying leads, to the line, neutral and earth terminals at the remote \nend  of  the  circuit  under  test.  (If  a  neutral  is  not  available,  e.g. \nin  the  case  of  a  three-phase  motor,  connect  the  neutral  probe  to  \nearth.)\n\n  3.   Press to test and record the value indicated.\n\nIt must be understood that this instrument reading is not valid for direct \ncomparison  with  the  tabulated  maximum  values,  as  account  must  be \ntaken of the ambient temperature at the time of test and the maximum \nconductor  operating  temperature,  both  of  which  will  have  an  effect  on \nconductor resistance. Hence, the (R1 + R2) value is likely to be greater at \nthe time of the fault than at the time of the test.\n\nSo, the measured value of Zs may be compared with the maximum value \nby  carrying  out  a  calculation  involving  various  correction  factors.  This \nmethod is lengthy and unlikely to be used in general situations. The fol-\nlowing rule of thumb method is preferred.\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n113\n\nThe  tabulated  maximum  value  of  Zs  is  multiplied  by  0.8  and  the  mea-\nsured value compared with this corrected value:\n\nCompare Zs measured with Zs maximum \u00d7 0.8\n\nTable 7.4 gives the 0.8 values of tabulated loop impedance for direct com-\nparison with measured values.\n\nIn effect, a loop impedance test places a line\u2013earth fault on the installation \nand, if an RCD is present, it may not be possible to conduct the test, as the \ndevice will trip out each time the loop impedance tester button is pressed.\n\nUnless the instrument is of a type that has a built-in guard against such \ntripping, the value of Zs will have to be determined from measured values \nof Ze and (R1 + R2).\n\n  Note \n\nNever short out an RCD in order to conduct this test.\n\nAs  a  loop  impedance  test  creates  a  high  earth  fault  current,  albeit  for \na  short  space  of  time,  some  lower-rated  circuit  breakers  may  operate, \nresulting in the same situation as with an RCD, and Zs will have to be \ncalculated. It is not really good practice to temporarily replace the circuit \nbreaker with one of a higher rating.\n\nExternal loop impedance Ze\n\nThe  value  of  Ze  is  measured  at  the  intake  position  on  the  supply  side  \nwith  the  earthing  conductor  disconnected.  Unless  the  installation  can  \nbe isolated from the supply, this test should not be carried out, as a poten-\ntial shock risk will exist with the supply on and the earthing conductor \ndisconnected.\n\nRCD operation\n\nWhere RCDs are \ufb01tted, it is essential that they operate within set param-\neters. The RCD testers used are designed to do just this. The basic tests \nrequired are as follows (Table 7.5 gives further details).\n\n\f0\n0\n2\n\n0\n6\n1\n\n5\n2\n1\n\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n8\n\n3\n6\n\n0\n6\n\n0\n5\n\n5\n4\n\n0\n4\n\n2\n3\n\n0\n3\n\n5\n2\n\n0\n2\n\n6\n1\n\n5\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n6\n\n5\n\n9\n2\n.\n0\n\n5\n3\n.\n0\n\n5\n.\n0\n\n6\n5\n.\n0\n\n7\n.\n0\n\n7\n8\n.\n0\n\n9\n0\n.\n1\n\n4\n.\n1\n\n5\n7\n.\n1\n\n9\n1\n.\n2\n\n5\n.\n3\n\n2\n8\n.\n5\n\ns\n5\n&\ns\n4\n.\n0\n\n4\n1\n.\n0\n\n7\n1\n.\n0\n\n2\n.\n0\n\n8\n2\n.\n0\n\n5\n3\n.\n0\n\n4\n4\n.\n0\n\n4\n5\n.\n0\n\n1\n7\n.\n0\n\n7\n8\n.\n0\n\n9\n0\n.\n1\n\n5\n7\n.\n1\n\n9\n.\n2\n\ns\n5\n&\ns\n4\n.\n0\n\n7\n0\n.\n0\n\n8\n0\n.\n0\n\n1\n.\n0\n\n3\n1\n.\n0\n\n7\n1\n.\n0\n\n2\n2\n.\n0\n\n8\n2\n.\n0\n\n5\n3\n.\n0\n\n4\n4\n.\n0\n\n4\n5\n.\n0\n\n7\n8\n.\n0\n\n6\n4\n.\n1\n\ns\n4\n.\n0\n\n4\n1\n.\n0\n\n7\n1\n.\n0\n\n2\n2\n.\n0\n\n7\n2\n.\n0\n\n5\n3\n.\n0\n\n4\n4\n.\n0\n\n5\n5\n.\n0\n\n9\n6\n.\n0\n\n7\n8\n.\n0\n\n9\n0\n.\n1\n\n5\n7\n.\n1\n\n1\n9\n.\n2\n\ns\n5\n\n2\n3\n.\n0\n\n5\n4\n.\n0\n\n3\n8\n.\n0\n\n4\n3\n.\n1\n\n4\n9\n.\n1\n\n2\n2\n.\n7\n\ns\n4\n.\n0\n\nd\nn\na\n\n8\n9\n8\n0\n6\nN\nE\n\nS\nB\n\nB\n\ne\np\ny\nt\n\n9\n0\n0\n1\n6\n\nd\nn\na\n\n8\n9\n8\n0\n6\nN\nE\n\nS\nB\n\nC\n\ne\np\ny\nt\n\n9\n0\n0\n1\n6\n\nd\nn\na\n\n8\n9\n8\n0\n6\nN\nE\n\nS\nB\n\nD\ne\np\ny\nt\n\n9\n0\n0\n1\n6\n\nG\nN\nI\nT\nA\nR\nN\nO\nI\nT\nC\nE\nT\nO\nR\nP\n\nE\nC\nI\nV\nE\nD\nE\nV\nI\nT\nC\nE\nT\nO\nR\nP\n\ns\ne\nu\na\nV\n\nl\n\nd\ne\nr\nu\ns\na\ne\nM\nh\n\nt\ni\n\nw\nn\no\ns\ni\nr\na\np\nm\no\nC\nr\no\nf\n\ns\ne\nu\na\nV\n\nl\n\ns\nZ\nm\nu\nm\ni\nx\na\nM\nd\ne\nt\nc\ne\nr\nr\no\n

Set the instrument to deliver the full-rated tripping current of the \n\nRCD.\n\n  5.   Operate the instrument and the RCD should trip out in the required \n\ntime.\n\nWhen  an  RCD  is  used  for  additional  protection  against  shock,  it  must \nbe tested at 30 mA or less and operate within 40 ms when subjected to a \ntripping current of \ufb01ve times its rating (IDn).\n\nTest instruments have the facility to provide this value of tripping current. \nThere is no point in conducting this \u2018fast trip\u2019 test if an RCD has a rating \nin excess of 30 mA.\n\nAll RCDs have a built-in test facility in the form of a test button. Oper-\nating  this  test  facility  creates  an  arti\ufb01cial  out-of-balance  condition  that \ncauses the device to trip. This only checks the mechanics of the tripping \noperation, it is not a substitute for the instrument tests.\n\nAll other items of equipment such as switchgear, controlgear interlocks, \netc.,  must  be  checked  to  ensure  that  they  are  correctly  mounted  and \nadjusted and that they function correctly.\n\nProspective fault current\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  that  protective  devices  have  the  correct  \u2018breaking \ncapacity\u2019,  a  measurement  of  prospective  fault  current  should  be  taken \nusing a PFC tester. It is connected in the same way as for an earth fault \nloop impedance test in order to obtain the prospective earth fault current \n\n\f118\n\nInspection and Testing\n\n(PEFC)  and  tested  between  line  and  neutral  to  measure  the  prospective \nshort-circuit current (PSCC).\n\nWhere domestic premises have a consumer unit to BS EN 61439-3 and \nthe DNO declares the PFC to be 16 kA (this is the case in most instances), \nthen no measurement need be made.\n\nFunctional testing\n\nApart from the electrical test on an RCD, there is a requirement to carry \nout a functional test, via its test button, to ensure that the  mechanism is \nnot defective. This test should be applied quarterly (by the user). \n\nAlso,  items  of  equipment  such  as  switches,  timers,  thermostats,  PIR \nlumin aires,  etc.,  should  be  checked  for  correct  installation,  adjustment \nand operation.\n\nPeriodic inspection\n\nThis  could  be  so  simple.  As  it  is,  periodic  inspection  and  testing  tends \nto be complicated and frustrating. On the domestic scene, few if any house \nowners actually decide to have a regular inspection. The usual response \nis, \u2018If it works, it must be OK\u2019. It is usually only when there is a change \nof ownership that the mortgage companies insist on an electrical survey.\n\nLet  us  assume  that  the  original  installation  was  erected  in  accordance \nwith  the  IET  Wiring  Regulations,  and  that  any  alterations  and/or  addi-\ntions have been faithfully recorded on the original documentation (which \nis, of course, readily available!).\n\nA periodic inspection and test under these circumstances should be rela-\ntively easy, as little dismantling of the installation will be necessary and \nthe bulk of the work will be inspection.\n\nInspection should be carried out with the supply disconnected as it may \nbe  necessary  to  gain  access  to  wiring  in  enclosures,  etc.  So,  with  large \ninstal la tions, it will probably need considerable liaison with the client to \narrange convenient times for interruption of supplies to various parts of the \ninstallation.\n\n\fInspection and Testing\n\n119\n\nThis  is  also  the  case  when  testing  protective  conductors  as  these  \nmust never be disconnected unless the supply can be isolated. This is par-\nticularly important for main protective bonding conductors which need to \nbe disconnected in order to measure Ze.\n\nIn the main, an inspection should reveal:\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)any aspects of the installation that may impair the safety of persons \n\nand livestock against the effects of electric shock and burns\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)that there are no installation defects that could give rise to heat and \n\n\ufb01re and so damage property\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)that the installation is not damaged or deteriorated so as to impair \n\nsafety\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)that any defects or non-compliance with the regulations, which may \n\ngive rise to danger, are identi\ufb01ed.\n\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)that all protective devices have the correct rating and setting\n(cid:402)(cid:3) (cid:3)that  all  monitoring  devices  (if  any)  have  the  correct  rating  and \n\nsetting\n\nAs mentioned earlier, dismantling should be kept to a minimum and, as a \nresult, a certain amount of sampling will take place. This sampling would \nneed to be increased if defects were found.\n\nFrom  the  testing  point  of  view,  not  all  of  the  tests  carried  out  on  the  \ninitial  inspection  may  need  to  be  applied.  This  decision  depends  on \nthe condition of the installation.\n\nThe continuity of protective conductors is clearly important, as is insu-\nlation  resistance  and  loop  impedance,  but  one  wonders  if  polarity  tests \nare necessary if the installation has remained undisturbed since the last \ninspection. The same applies to ring circuit continuity as the L\u2013N test is \napplied to detect interconnections in the ring, which would not happen \non their own!\n\nCerti\ufb01cation\n\nHaving  completed  all  the  inspection  checks  and  carried  out  all  the \n relevant tests, this information needs to be documented. This is done on \nElectrical  Installation  Certi\ufb01cates  (EICs),  Electrical  Installation  Condi-\ntion Reports (EICRs), inspections schedules, test result schedules, Minor \n\n\f120\n\nInspection and Testing\n\nElectrical Installation Works Certi\ufb01cates (MEIWCs) and any other docu-\nmentation you wish to add. Examples of this documentation are shown \nin the IET Regulations and the IET Guidance Note 3 on inspection and \ntesting.\n\nThis documentation is vital. It has to be correct and signed by a compe-\ntent person. EICs and EICRs must be accompanied by a schedule of test \nresults and an inspection schedule for them to be valid. Three signatures \nare needed on an EIC, one in respect of the design, one in respect of the \nconstruction and one in respect of the inspection and test. It could be, of \ncourse, that for a very small company, one person signs all three parts. \nWhatever the case, the original must be given to the person ordering the \nwork and a duplicate retained by the contractor.\n\nOne important aspect of the EIC is the recommended interval between \ninspections.  This  should  be  evaluated  by  the  designer  and  will  depend \non the type of installation and its usage. In some cases, the time interval \nis  mandatory,  especially  where  environments  are  subject  to  use  by  the \npublic. The IET Guidance Note 3 gives the recommended maximum fre-\nquencies between inspections.\n\nAn Electrical Installation Condition report form is very similar in part to \nan EIC as regards the details of the installation (i.e. maximum demand, \ntype of earthing system and Ze). The rest of the form deals with the extent \nand  limitations  of  the  inspection  and  test,  the  recommendations  and  a \nsummary of the installation. The record of the extent and limitations of \nthe inspection is very important. It must be agreed with the client or other \nthird  party  exactly  what  parts  of  the  installation  will  be  covered  by  the \nreport and what parts won\u2019t.\n\nWith regard to the schedule of test results, test values should be recorded \nunadjusted, any compensation for temperature, etc., being made after the \ntesting is completed.\n\nAny alterations or additions to an installation will be subject to the issue \nof an EIC, except where the addition is, say, a single point added to an \nexisting circuit; then the work is subject to the issue of a Minor Works \nCerti\ufb01cate.\n\n\fC H A P T E R   2\nC H A P T E R   8\n\nSecurity Alarm and  \nTelephone Systems\n\nImportant terms/topics covered in this chapter:\n\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)  Security systems\n(cid:402)  Passive infrared and magnetic sensors\n(cid:402)  Domestic telephone systems\n\nBy the end of this chapter the reader should:\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:3)\n\n(cid:402)  be  aware  of  the  operation  and  installation  of  simple  security  \n\nsystems,\n\n(cid:402)  know  how  to  carry  out  simple  additions  to  domestic  telephone \n\nsystems.\n\nSECURITY ALARMS\n\nThere  are  two  types  of  intruder  alarm  system  available,  the  hard-wired \nsystem and the wireless variety. Clearly, the latter appears attractive from \nan installation point of view, as there are no cables to be run. However, \nnuisance operation can be caused by stray radio frequencies unrelated to \nthe system. The hardwired type is preferred as it is very reliable.\n\nSimple systems\n\nMost domestic premises require only the most basic of systems, usually \ncomprising an electronically operated control panel, a number of sensors \n(either passive infrared (PIR) or magnetic) and a sounder (bell or siren). \nOperation of any sensor is detected by the control panel and the sounder \nactivated. Figure 8.1 shows a block diagram of this set-up.\n\nMost systems are of the \u2018closed-circuit\u2019 type, in which the sensors have \n\u2018normally closed\u2019 (N/C) contacts. Operation of a sensor opens these con-\ntacts and the alarm sounder is activated. Cutting through cables has the \nsame effect as operation of a sensor.\n\n18th Edition IET Wiring Regulations: Electric Wiring for Domestic Installers. 978-1-138-60604-3.\n\u00a9 Brian Scaddan.

Careful  consideration  must  be  given  to  the  siting  of  PIRs  in \norder to gain the best possible protection.\n\nMagnetic sensors require no supply, as they are simply a pair of contacts \nheld closed by the proximity of a magnet.

A 3 kW 230 V immersion heater has ceased to work although fuses, \netc.,  are  all  intact.  A  test  using  a  low-resistance  ohmmeter  should \nreveal the heater\u2019s resistance, which can be determined from:\n\nP (cid:27) V2/R\n  So, R (cid:27) V2/P\n\n= \n\n230 \u00d7 230\n\n(cid:17)(cid:14)(cid:14)(cid:14)\n\n=\n\n52 900\n\n3000\n\n= 17.6 (cid:49)\n\n  This can be compared with the manufacturer\u2019s intended resistance. \nThis would show that the element is not broken and further inves-\ntigation should take place (probably a faulty thermostat).\n\n  2.  Two lighting points have been wired, incorrectly, in series. The effect \non the light output from two 100 W/230 V lamps connected to these \npoints can be shown as follows:\n  Each lamp will have a resistance of R (cid:27) V2/P (when hot)\n\n= \n\n230 \u00d7 230\n\n(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:14)\n\n=\n\n52 900\n\n100\n\n= 529 (cid:49)\n\n  It  will  be  seen  that  each  lamp  will  have  only  115  V  as  a  supply \n (Figure  A1.4).  Hence  each  will  deliver  a  power  of  P  (cid:27)  V2/R,  giving \n\n115 \u00d7 115\n\n(cid:19)(cid:16)(cid:23)\n\n=\n\n25 W\n\n  which is a quarter of its rated value, and so both lamps will be only \na quarter of their intended brightness.\n\n  3.  The  current  \ufb02owing  in  a  10  m  length  of  2.5  mm2  twin  cable  is  \n12 A. The resistance of such cable is approximately 0.015 (cid:49)/m, so \nthe power consumed by the cable would be:\n  P (cid:27) I2 (cid:61) R\n  (cid:27) 12 (cid:61) 12 (cid:61) 0.015 (cid:61) 10 (cid:27) 21.6 W\n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f132\n\nAppendix 1\n\n\u03a9\n529Q \n\n115V \n\n\u03a9\n529Q \n\n115V \n\n    FIGURE A1.4    Lamps in series.\n\n230 V \n\n\fC H A P T E R   2\nA P P E N D I X   2\n\nConductor Identi\ufb01cation,  \nNotices and Warning Labels\n\nCONDUCTOR IDENTIFICATION\n\nThe  following  are  the  colours/alphanumeric  references  required  by  the \nIET Wiring Regulations:\n\nConductor\n\nLetter/Number\n\nColour\n\nSingle-phase a.c.\n\nThree-phase a.c.\n\nControl wiring or ELV\n\nL\n\nN\n\nL1\n\nL2\n\nL3\n\nN\n\nL\n\nLine\n\nNeutral\n\nLine 1\n\nLine 2\n\nLine 3\n\nNeutral\n\nLine \n\nNeutral\n\nBrown\n\nBlue\n\nBrown\n\nBlack\n\nGrey\n\nBlue\n\nBrown, Black, Red, Orange, \n\nYellow, Violet, Grey, \nWhite, Pink or Turquoise\n\nBlue\n\nFor all systems\n\nProtective\n\nGreen-yellow\n\n18th Edition IET Wiring Regulations: Electric Wiring for Domestic Installers. 978-1-138-60604-3.\n\u00a9 Brian Scaddan.
