1.1 Title
1.1.1 This standard is the British Standard for the safety of electrical installations. It sets standards for the design, construction, inspection, testing and maintenance of electrical installations, and requires them to be installed to a standard that provides a reasonable degree of safety to persons and property.
1.1.2 This standard covers the United Kingdom and is intended to provide for the safety of persons, livestock and property against dangers and damage that may arise in the reasonable use of electrical installations and to do so with a degree of reliability and compatibility with other systems that is appropriate to the intended use of those installations.
1.1.3 This standard is concerned with the safety of persons and livestock against dangers and damage that may arise from electrical installations, including electrical equipment, and is not intended to be a design specification or an instruction manual for unskilled persons.
1.1.4 The requirements of this standard apply to the design, erection and verification of electrical installations, and also to additions and alterations to existing installations.
1.1.5 The requirements of this standard apply to the design, erection and verification of temporary electrical installations and their components.
1.2 Object
1.2.1 The object of this standard is to establish requirements which will provide an appropriate standard of protection against the risks of death or personal injury, and damage to property and other losses which may be caused by failure of electrical installations.
1.2.2 The object of this standard is to ensure that the safety of persons and property is not compromised during the life of an electrical installation.
1.2.3 The object of this standard is to promote the development of electrical installation practices which minimise the likelihood of damage to property and injury to persons.
1.3 Fundamental principles
1.3.1 The following fundamental principles are recognised as being important in achieving the object of this standard.
- Every electrical installation shall be safe and have an appropriate standard of protection against the risks of death or personal injury and damage to property and other losses.
- Every electrical installation shall be designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with the fundamental principles that are set out in this standard.
- Every electrical installation shall be designed and constructed to avoid danger and to minimise the risk of damage to property and injury to persons.
- Every electrical installation shall be designed and constructed to minimise electromagnetic disturbances to other equipment and systems.
- Every electrical installation shall be designed and constructed with regard to the principles of environmental protection and energy efficiency.
- Every electrical installation shall be maintained and periodically inspected and tested to ensure that it continues to be safe."
